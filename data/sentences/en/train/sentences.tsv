And the day before I had to go teaching for the first time, I thought too much and came up with all sorts of scenarios. Horror, of course. Can I explain everything to him well? What if he doesn't understand? What if he doesn't pass the comparative tests and can't progress to the sixth grade because of me?	And the day before I had to go teaching for the first time, I thought too much and came up with all sorts of scenarios.	Experience	[5, 4]
4128	But by just visiting here, I'm just thinking about how I would do it, to be there permanently. And I hope better or at least with a better approach, but I know it's easy to talk like that. When I started my practice in October, I was terribly scared.	And I hope better or at least with a better approach, but I know it's easy to talk like that.	Feeling	[4, 4]
4531	But the big point is that a personal relationship is important and that signs don't have to be absolutely motivating. And most importantly, to praise, at least for something, is always for something. As I mentioned in a previous newspaper, I practice Czech language in high school. It's an extremely rewarding experience for me because I went to high school.	And most importantly, to praise, at least for something, is always for something.	Belief	[4, 6]
2588	In one math class, I experienced a mess. I didn't know how to calculate one example. I had no idea how to go about it. And especially how to grind out of it. First one girl had to count it, then I sat down here because I started to hesitate with the solution myself. And I didn't calculate it.	And especially how to grind out of it.	Other	[5]
1025	And most importantly, we must at least try to change his bad experiences and show interest in his opinion, his talent, in himself. A smile or praise does not cost anyone anything, but sometimes miracles are seduced.	And most importantly, we must at least try to change his bad experiences and show interest in his opinion, his talent, in himself.	Belief	[1, 4]
461	What will it do for me, I thought. I'd rather be a stateswoman. I experienced supervision with the teacher. It's crazy. Kids fly here and there. They wash, they stroke. And most of all, they come and see me. He did it to me, he did it again. He started it. I don't understand that this phrase isn't covered yet.	And most of all, they come and see me.	Experience	[4, 3]
2815	"I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by how the management and teachers in the classroom treated me. Everyone was nice, helpful. And most importantly - I didn't feel like I was bothering anyone here. Since I already had a few internships, I must admit that they were not always ""enthusiastic"" about me."	And most importantly - I didn't feel like I was bothering anyone here.	Feeling	[6, 3]
1062	During the trip to the class, the teacher also recommended a place for me to sit so that it would not be so unpleasant. And right after the welcome, she told me in front of everyone to take a chair and sit back at the window. I didn't trust them in the cabinet. Not really. But it was so !!! Pupils will probably find this smell normal, because they did not have an open window in the classroom even during the break.	And right after the welcome, she told me in front of everyone to take a chair and sit back at the window.	Experience	[1, 4]
1657	Which I tried to use the very next day.	And even though the preparations are very demanding and stressful for me, it no longer seems to me to teach independently.	Feeling	[6, 3]
564	I find the hour successful, especially in terms of safety and the chosen recipe. And even though it was just listening in class that day, the students immediately accepted me in a completely positive way and even encouraged me to taste and choose the best work :-D - of course I could not resist this offer, so I was happy to sacrifice in benefit the class and tasted everything properlyJ. In the future, I plan to visit the kitchens again (and more often).	And even though it was just listening in class that day, the students immediately accepted me in a completely positive way and even encouraged me to taste and choose the best work :-D - of course I could not resist this offer, so I was happy to sacrifice in benefit the class and tasted everything properlyJ.	Feeling	[4, 3]
665	She was a big help to me. And as I had it well prepared, I wasn't even nervous and it turned out well. But what I failed is a geography lesson. I try to come up with interesting activities and then I can't stop it. Group work is quite demanding for teachers.	And as I had it well prepared, I wasn't even nervous and it turned out well.	Feeling	[3, 5]
5181	And as a future pedagogue, I would know how to approach it and take students and according to what criteria to evaluate. The most surprising thing that happened to me at my school lately was this. I came to school as always.	And as a future pedagogue, I would know how to approach it and take students and according to what criteria to evaluate.	Reflection	[3, 3]
5615	Plus, I thought I'd never do anything I didn't like in elementary school. And it is easy to say that I never wanted to be like the above-mentioned colleague, because this teacher taught me myself. But what now, when the students, you might say, directly demand that I behave the same way.	And it is easy to say that I never wanted to be like the above-mentioned colleague, because this teacher taught me myself.	Reflection	[4, 4]
393	The teacher then praised me very much. Although she is quite a critical person, she said that this 8. And is a very problematic class and it is difficult to keep calm in it. That I managed it very nicely, I kept order and it was clear that the children enjoyed it.	And it is a very problematic class and it is difficult to keep calm in it.	Difficulty	[5, 6]
104	I am determined that when the practice comes again in March, I will throw myself into it with enthusiasm. And one day I will be a real teacher and I will try to do the best I can for the children. Well, if they keep rolling their eyes, I'll give them a note, because what? Because I can!	And one day I will be a real teacher and I will try to do the best I can for the children.	Intention	[4, 4]
4639	Did it give me so much work and effect? Almost none. How many times did students just stand by their mobile phones and look for one answer to one question in a 15-minute crossword puzzle. And their reading literacy? But I have to believe that if I build the students myself, it will be better.	And their reading literacy?	Reflection	[2, 6]
6533	Success. The accompanying teacher then told me that this is unfortunately what it looks like in most schools. In her opinion (and other teachers there), a second foreign language for children does not belong in primary school. And after this experience, I find that I completely agree with her. A second foreign language should only be taught in multi-year grammar schools and secondary schools.	And after this experience, I find that I completely agree with her.	Learning	[3, 4]
966	A lot of people from the area also tell me that I am very kind, kind, decent and can't imagine me in an educational role. And I don't even know what style I want to educate future generations with. Many times I read books about alternative approaches to students, their evaluation, motivation, fair approach in education. Ideas e.g.	And I don't even know what style I want to educate future generations with.	Difficulty	[3, 4]
4092	And the motivation could have been better. Well, as you can see, the teaching can be different. Somewhere it works better, somewhere worse. And I will learn for a long time to know how to do it. Juchuuu - the last reflective diary! However, I will return to practice.	And I will learn for a long time to know how to do it.	Belief	[5, 3]
3381	"What happened inevitably had to happen - the students got used to my presence and no longer ""stared"" at me. And I feel better and move more naturally after school. And now for the clock itself. I was looking forward to them. Of course, there was also nervousness, but I take it for granted."	And I feel better and move more naturally after school.	Feeling	[4, 6]
2340	And especially how to grind out of it. First one girl had to count it, then I sat down here because I started to hesitate with the solution myself. And I didn't calculate it. The accompanying teacher was not there at the moment, and none of the children could tell me that there were results in the back of the textbook. They stink, they let me take a bath.	And I didn't calculate it.	Difficulty	[4, 3]
1776	I know that the waters cannot be completely saved, at least not us here inland, but we can help in some way. And that's how I felt. J All drawings dried slowly and the document was still running. We and the children slowly began to uncover the beauty under the surface / save all living organisms. Suddenly, beautiful creations were created.	And that's how I felt.	Feeling	[5, 5]
285	I stood with the students at the door and waited for the service to clean up the classroom, meanwhile one of the students praised my pants in front of everyone. And I didn't know how to react at the time.	And I didn't know how to react at the time.	Difficulty	[3, 3]
931	And do you know that they laughed behind your back the whole time? As they were in threes, they didn't look at you at all and they were on the phone! âWell, it was painted. And I knew that next time I would not succeed with generalization or working in threes. 2nd hour (April 2, 2019) I set off for the second hour with an unpleasant feeling in my stomach.	And I knew that next time I would not succeed with generalization or working in threes.	Difficulty	[5, 4]
4204	He finished the sentence and waited for me to answer something. In fact, the whole class was waiting for me to say. And I? I was also waiting to say what I would say. I'll say it.	And I? I was also waiting to say what I would say.	Experience	[3, 3]
5566	When I wanted to give examples, someone always answered me. And if not by chance, I caught a name in my memory and addressed the student. I mainly tried to address students I knew they didn't pay much attention to. I think it worked quite well.	And if not by chance, I caught a name in my memory and addressed the student.	Experience	[5, 5]
3431	She is very energetic and tries to attract students, sometimes she succeeds more sometimes sometimes less. He uses a lot of gestures and facial expressions, which sometimes helps a lot. And when I think about it like that, I would like to use it during teaching as well. It'll probably take a while for me not to feel like a jerk. A teacher is such an actor. That's another thing I'll have to learn.	And when I think about it like that, I would like to use it during teaching as well.	Reflection	[5, 6]
192	At the beginning of the lesson there was a test for a substance about Great Moravia. There was a grave silence at the writing, no one dared wait. And when someone waited, the teacher processed it properly. She gained respect in a completely natural way. All she had to do was raise her voice or frown a little, the children knew what that meant.	And when someone waited, the teacher processed it properly.	Other	[5, 5]
3720	And maybe he just wants to know that someone is interested in his opinion. Maybe it was because of his opinion that he was in the office. Maybe it's because he has an opinion that he perceives him as a problem student. And maybe it's also completely different. Hard to judge. of the few hours I spent there. It just occurred to me that he was somehow labeled with the teachers and he didn't appear to me at all at that hour.	And maybe it's also completely different.	Reflection	[3, 4]
3797	The children chose English as their most popular language, and German displeased her. And maybe after an hour of listening, I found out why this is so. The first crucial factor is that German starts in the 6th grade and English in the 2nd grade.	And maybe after an hour of listening, I found out why this is so.	Reflection	[3, 5]
3710	Since I've never taught yet, it's all new. And I must admit that a lot has changed since my elementary education. A lot of students have paper for such and such a disorder and require a special approach, and that scares me. That was what surprised me the most.	And I must admit that a lot has changed since my elementary education.	Belief	[5, 5]
5236	He tells them a lot of interesting things, uses presentations, videos. At present, I have taught 8 hours of history and 3 hours of Czech language and literature. So for now, I have to say that I learn history much better, because I have more knowledge in it and I am more confident during teaching and planning. The biggest weakness for me is the Czech grammar.	So for now, I have to say that I learn history much better, because I have more knowledge in it and I am more confident during teaching and planning.	Reflection	[4, 5]
64	After learning a few hours, I can say that I was always happy when I finished class. And I think that the students were also satisfied and they liked the topics and enjoyed them.	And I think that the students were also satisfied and they liked the topics and enjoyed them.	Reflection	[5, 5]
5362	But there is never such silence as I regularly experienced in class with a chemistry teacher. Experience for me: the same class responds completely differently to other teachers. And I don't think it's a pity that any teacher can teach and involve students, even if there's no complete silence. It occurred to me that in science lessons, they are much more accessible and open to communication, thanks to this more benevolent approach to complete silence in the classroom.	And I don't think it's a pity that any teacher can teach and involve students, even if there's no complete silence.	Reflection	[6, 4]
4055	And I'm really happy with it and a little bit of myself. Another event during my internship that affected me was assisting a student with a mild mental disability.	And I'm really happy with it and a little bit of myself.	Feeling	[6, 6]
5826	"And immediately after that he marked a friend with whom he was ""angry"". I told them to describe exactly what they were doing. I could see in my expression that they were pretty uncomfortable with them. And it was annoying to me too. ""What am I doing? I can work it out with them in peace, alone during the break. Well, but. . . it might not have any effect either. . ."	And it was annoying to me too.	Feeling	[6, 5]
5065	Actually, I don't know what else to add. I was and I am satisfied that I have practice at this school. And I was lucky that my first steps in learning were a joy rather than a pain. I was lucky with both the accompanying teachers and the students. That meant a lot to me, because I need a nice start, pleasant conditions.	And I was lucky that my first steps in learning were a joy rather than a pain.	Feeling	[4, 5]
1101	B. The teachers in the cabinet warned me. Supposedly, let me not forgive anything and be evil. I didn't know what to do with it, can I be mean? How bad? And who exactly? Should a teacher be bad at all? What will it help? I went to the class very nervous, expecting the atmosphere of hell.	And to whom exactly?	Reflection	[3, 6]
6856	I have met various children from the deaf, to learning disabilities, mental disabilities, severe speech impairments, Down syndrome, autism and so on. And at this school I am still unpleasantly surprised by the approach of teachers to students. Most teachers are on a break in the classroom, where they talk terribly ugly about students.	And at this school I am still unpleasantly surprised by the approach of teachers to students.	Feeling	[5, 5]
659	During these tasks, check the children, ask additional questions, help them with the elaboration, etc. And finally or during the course to have an ideal pre-found short max. 5 minute video directly on the topic. 5 minute video directly on the topic. The hour went quite well as a result, I don't think there was any explicitly critical or downright spoiled moment.

And finally Dominika, who was diagnosed with developmental dysphasia.	Other	[5, 5]
234	I supported such an atmosphere with questions about students' privacy. One activity was based on true / false statements and thanks to it I learned more students. Conversely, the students learned more about me, as I also took part in the activity. What I had a little problem with was eye contact. Sometimes I didn't know if the students were nervous about my direct eye contact.	Conversely, the students learned more about me, as I also took part in the activity.	Experience	[4, 4]
5565	And not one - even two in a single semester! I don't know what to explain ?! Maybe by the fact that us men on pedagogy are like saffron?	And not one - even two in a single semester!	Other	[6, 6]
6764	I hope to come in time next time. So here I go! The first two lessons learned are a thing of the past. And it wasn't so bad. I thought I would learn more from the Crusades, but paradoxically I feel better about the second topic - Maria Theresa.	And it wasn't so bad.	Other	[6, 4]
1836	In the afternoon I went to teach until 6. C. I changed the preparation even more, because I knew what did not work in 6. And. The lesson went much better and my mood immediately improved thanks to that. Pupils enjoyed the activity from the point of view and reacted perfectly. What could it be?	And it didn't work.	Other	[6, 6]
3673	She always told me a few sentences of evaluation for my own teaching, and although I know that it wasn't exactly perfect, I would probably appreciate a little more praise, or rather motivation. And what annoys me the most is that even though I created an activity for children that I find really good, such a special repetitive test, for which we agreed that the best 1 or 2 students will get one, and everyone will stick them under the enrollment, so she didn't even return it to the children, corrected by me, there can be no talk of ones at all, and that she has no room for that anymore. So I actually did it unnecessarily. . .

773	An incredible scream, I was surprised that none of my colleagues came to us! And you shouldn't have discussed the whole of North Africa today? Then you will discuss the Gulf of Guinea next time! And do you know that they laughed behind your back the whole time?	And shouldn't you have discussed all of North Africa today?	Other	[5, 4]
5416	Raised voice, shouting, constant reprimands and deadlines. The semester is approaching and the marks from natural history are the worst among other subjects.

1738	The doctor advised me to always be silent when the students start to make noise. And I can't start talking until he calms down completely.

5058	He wrote a note and only then could he go to lunch. Reflection: I don't know what happened. I don't know why it happened. And I don't know how I was supposed to behave. I wouldn't have thought of sending someone out the door like this, but I ran out of ideas. I tried a strict teacher, I tried a discussing teacher, I tried an ignoring teacher.	And I don't know how I was supposed to behave.	Difficulty	[6, 3]
4343	If he wanted to, he would be number one. Only a military drill will do this! â The teacher told me that the boy had a hard time at home and that he had become more and more depressed lately. And I was all the more shocked by what happened during the interception. In science, the circulatory system was discussed, and the teacher wanted the children to read a paragraph in the textbook and tell her what they had learned.	And I was all the more shocked by what happened during the interception.	Feeling	[6, 6]
622	I tell myself that we are still learning to learn, so it's fine, but I'm just the type who, when he already does something, wants to do well.

4760	And then how to explain it to the students in the classroom? And how to treat that boy, and I think she did great. I admired her. I enjoyed the Days of Geography, but I wasn't the only one. Everyone was excited about it.	And I did great in my opinion.	Reflection	[5, 4]
2707	I was quite confident in my teaching, because I knew that I had a similar course that I had already experienced. And nothing really happened that would surprise me. However, in this practice I actually discussed only practically, which I think is definitely easier. I am curious how I will be able to discuss the theory in other practices, for example.	And nothing really happened that would surprise me.	Feeling	[4, 3]
1317	In the hospital class, I met VaÅ¡ek again, whom I had to reprimand last week. The first thing the teacher told him was to clean things around the desk.

2688	However, the truth is that at the beginning of the beginning teacher profession, such situations will certainly occur 100%. And then it will be my responsibility to deal with it in reality.

It interrupted my hour at that moment. The teacher raised her voice to them, intimidating them into dealing with them later (when I probably wouldn't be there).

1621	I couldn't get rid of the idea that I had to speak otherwise so as not to sound uncomfortable, and I paid all my attention to it. Not children, as I was used to. And I don't think so.

1417	In some mysterious way, however, they always had everything relatively well written down.

1551	Great. . But I wonder why such moods arose in society that gave rise to these ideologies? What does communism and fascism actually mean, and please, teacher, do not confuse fascism with Nazism, as it comes to language. . It turns me so terrible during those hours. As for the very active participation of students in lessons, it is not much required. And when it is, you can see what goulash students have in it.	And please, teacher, don't confuse fascism with Nazism, as it just comes to the language ... It makes me so awful during those classes.	Feeling	[6, 4]
3537	And one hour a week is really not enough. And that's why the citizen slips into the style of playing games and creating fun. In the current system, this is satisfactory. But is it right?

5183	But I did it. Finally, I had the opportunity to learn some proper grammar, which is something I'm even more afraid of than twenty-four children. And because I'm afraid of it, I thought it was necessary to get started and start getting rid of fear. I'm kidding, I had no choice. So I stood in front of seventh grade and went to explain the present perfect, a hot favorite of English times in elementary schools.	And because I'm afraid of it, I thought it was necessary to get started and start getting rid of fear.	Feeling	[5, 6]

3134	So I thought, why change for another when it may not be better. Although a bad experience is also a beneficial experience, I preferred to go for sure. And why the new accompanying teacher: First, the former one simply didn't list geography, and second, even if he did, I wouldn't choose it again.	And why a new accompanying teacher?	Reflection	[5, 4]
349	During the English week, I had classes in the seventh grade, where I discussed the topic of school with the students. I created various activities and worksheets for the students, which were bilingual. And just this week came the moment when these students also took an active part and even taught me in tandem, they always said it in English and I in German. I was glad that I enjoyed not only me, but especially the whole class.

4565	And they say I don't want anything from him, that he won't do anything anyway. Well, I think the assistant herself was watching. To cut a long story short, he was the most active student in the whole class.	And they say I don't want anything from him, that he won't do anything anyway.	Perspective	[5, 3]
494	And surprisingly, the school also dealt with it with my parents, because this was my first question after class for the teacher. And yet parents have to deal with it the most. So I thought to myself that I was a mother and knew this, so I controlled my child. Peru clothes him more often.	And yet parents have to deal with it the most.	Belief	[5, 3]
6455	But I forced myself to prepare it quite nicely. I used the textbook more. I almost literally stuck to it, or I added something extra that I found interesting.

BUT on the other hand, if the project is well prepared (including work assignments), the pupils will enjoy it and their work will be very high quality and sophisticated. All you need is a good introductory motivation for each lesson, which always kicks the pupils and reminds them why we do it and what we want to achieve. The second reflection is a day for nothing.

Sixes were active and relatively good, sevens are active, but they show a certain rebellion, and eights would rather do nothing.

But on the other hand, I was in a music class in another teacher, who tried not to suffocate the students so much. She wanted to leave space for them, but the students were very noisy, they were still disturbing, it was very difficult to explain something to them, to do something with them.

Everyone had the opportunity to improve their mark. But I was taken aback, which I really saw, that a seventh-grade student would take a paper voluntarily. The teacher gives him the opportunity to improve the grade, chooses a topic for him and he coughs it up. Normally he said that he did not and will not prepare the paper in the end.

But in short, the students were always very noisy, asked disproportionate questions, and worked a little slower than I would expect from ninth and eighth graders. But lately, it seems to me that the students are a little calmer here. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm used to it. In math class it is another oasis.

Fortunately, I saw for myself in a parallel class. I proceeded in exactly the same way when explaining, and the students understood everything with a third example.

I take it that the bad experience will only strengthen me, and now I will appreciate the knowledge when the children at school are as great as I experienced before. As part of my internship, I got into different grades. However, the 8th grade struck me the most and I stuck in my memory.

5090	Unfortunately, I soon found out that this class was not very communicative, so I had to change my lesson plans.

624	It was about something completely different for the fifth graders.

2396	History: In the last record of the experience of listening to history lessons, I introduced the person of the young accompanying teacher and the first concern about his approach to work. Unfortunately, I must state that this teaching is still unchanged. The teacher relies on the effect of frontal teaching and does not involve any media in his interpretation. The last hour with him was still hampered by his bad mood.	Unfortunately, I must state that this teaching is still unchanged.	Experience	[4, 5]

Unfortunately, I admit that I didn't do anything with him, I probably didn't have the courage to argue with him, it would end up disobeying me anyway. Throughout our two-hour class, my colleague and I had to improvise several times. I think we managed and we finished the hour.

4598	I didn't expect this to be so difficult either. Within hours, I always prepared more so that nothing would surprise me. Unfortunately, it happened to me that, for example, I rang in the middle of an activity and I did not complete a certain activity with the students and did not have time to check anything with them. So, in the end, I came across an activity that I had prepared completely useless, in short, without the control and evaluation of students. So I also tried to activate the students a lot in class.

Unfortunately, the contract for this project was signed by the former principal, and at the moment no one in the school knows what they are actually researching and what the conclusions should be. We don't get any feedback, because between hours the researchers disappear with the ringing and only return with the ringing for an hour, when they also leave after four o'clock.

This means that instead of 3 hours, everyone has 6 hours of French per week at a time. In the hours when there has to be a connection, they watch French movies.

2037	Pupils often have questions about the subject, but they are so stupid that the principal refuses to answer, which is not surprising. Unfortunately, with this procedure and ignoring other incoming questions from some individuals, it may happen that the pupils' motivation for the activity decreases negatively throughout the lesson. An interesting case is when two intruders are sitting next to each other, and the exaggerated eloquence of both causes each other to justify each other. Pupils are used to making notes according to the presentation.

At the beginning of each lesson, the teacher asked a topic and let the students come up with answers. Unfortunately, the imaginary answers were just screams into the darkness.

4660	The first variant is demanding, especially time consuming, for teachers. Words to list, attribute pronunciation and translation, type in a computer and print. The other two variants transfer responsibility to the student. Unfortunately, when children rewrite it themselves, they copy it inattentively and make mistakes there, and then they do it wrong, they learn with those mistakes. I've seen a few dictionaries and some really don't. It's either because they have some dysfunction, or simply because they're not paying attention.

I expected the lessons to be full of interesting things.

It was such the beginning of everything, when I didn't know how to react to it at all, and somehow I slowly went over it and probably tried not to notice.

Perhaps it would be pure fantasy to expect tandem teaching to increase the value of the lesson purely for the presence and perspective of the other teacher, but perhaps it should at least be possible to expect that the use of tandem instruction will not disrupt the lesson. The material that was discussed was not specific, so that each of the two teachers could not teach it individually, so even at this level, the lesson did not gain anything.

3836	At one o'clock I listened to a situation where the students were absolutely unbearable. They had fun, interrupted, the teacher tried several times to clean up the situation in the classroom, but without success. I felt sorry for the teacher and the few people who were careful. They tried their best, but the others absolutely disrespected. The teacher was tired after class and she was unhappy with the class herself.

510	My memories of high school physics came back to me. In the fourth grade, or perhaps even in the third grade, the teacher actually paid attention only to those who were really careful. He didn't care what the rest of the class did, he was in class for those who would be in physics. Maybe it's just my generalized view of the past, it is certain that I have kept this feeling of the clock in my memory to this day.	He didn't care what the rest of the class did, he was in class for those who would be in physics.	Other	[7, 5]
783	I think about what it is. . . Was it because I was new there and he felt threatened? Was he uncomfortable looking at him when I pointed out inattention? But I can't do that, I can't see anything, that I don't mind if I it bothers me that everything is fine. I wanted to clarify the rules with them.	Was it annoying that I was looking at him when I pointed out inattention?	Reflection	[4, 5]
2133	I told him to calm down and sit down elsewhere, so that we would deploy them anyway. It was obvious that he would rather send me somewhere, but he could only answer that he didn't care and that the bench was his. I knew right away that there would be problems with him.

6075	He said that next time we would try to write something again and then we would try the given sentence analysis on the sentences he wrote. I felt very good about the lesson. It was obvious that the student was looking forward to the next lesson with me and that he enjoyed this style of teaching. If I had to work with the whole class, it would be a lot different and I couldn't deal with him like that.	It was obvious that the student was looking forward to the next lesson with me and that he enjoyed this style of teaching.	Other	[6, 5]
3776	In addition, the subsequent evaluation after each question turned out that I always communicated with only one group and the other groups did not listen to the opinions of their classmates. But it was worse for me to get their attention back.	But it was worse for me to get their attention back.	Difficulty	[3, 6]
2799	I fixed everything this week - the pen is back with my owner. I evaluate my first experience with teaching positively, although I made a mistake in class. It was beneficial for me to find out that I feel good in the classroom with the students. From the next shift in practice, the issue of agreement with the accompanying teacher regarding the curriculum stuck in my head.

5976	It was Friday, the first hour after lunch, and I was to teach the polynomials. It was quite challenging, given the circumstances. However, there was one student who counted for an hour and had, in my opinion, a very good knowledge. It was a Roma pupil.	It was quite challenging, given the circumstances.	Difficulty	[2, 3]
6357	I always thought that the purpose of teaching was to teach students something and not to entertain them at school. After every one hour I was very mentally exhausted. It was very strenuous. I also didn't like the students, they are almost never taught to work independently.	It was very strenuous.	Difficulty	[3, 3]
6486	But maybe it's also a natural phase when we've switched from one teaching style to another. At first, they usually received a double page of materials. It was a lot about grammar. Exercises for compiling sentences, translation into Czech or English, below is a glossary of new words, above is a formula of a new grammatical construction. . .	It was a lot about grammar.	Other	[6, 6]
975	It happened to me that day, but another thing I'm still thinking about now. It was at the end of the citizen's class at 9th B, when one of the students made me a little embarrassed.

5716	But what really caught my eye was the absolutely disarming energy of the teacher, which she used to motivate students and thus good results in class. It was really captivating, so I almost signed up so I could write a sentence on the board and get a plus. I calculated that in one hour the students had the opportunity to improve their grades three times with small pluses. When students have 5 plus, they get one.

2067	After coming to class, the teacher introduced me to the students and said that I would watch the first lesson and the second one, that she had to bounce and I would lead the lesson.

300	So my first teaching in elementary school is behind me! I must say that I was quite scared, given the various comments on the teacher's lesson and my own unprofessionalism. It was the first time in history that I stood in front of the class and had to spend 2 hours with it. I must admit that it is quite different from the programs in the gallery (my second field). Just the fact that the children are sitting and the teacher is walking or standing around them.	It was the first time in history that I stood in front of the class and had to spend 2 hours with it.

It was definitely beneficial for me, I had a good feeling that I could help and work with the students myself.	Feeling	[7, 5]
2586	And that I could tell myself when I have had enough of listening and when I want to start teaching. It was a big plus for me, because I don't like it when someone pushes me into things and, on the contrary, it suits me when I can tell myself, for example, that I already want to teach.

3681	The teacher discussed copyright with the students. At the beginning of the lesson, she talked to the students about what copyright could be.

6228	There are a few students in the class (about two or three) who often interrupt and need to be reprimanded, especially one of them. It was sometimes like that in class with the teacher, when I was present for listening. The teacher restored order without any problems. As I wrote something on the board in my class, these students began to disturb.	It was sometimes like that in class with the teacher, when I was present for listening.	Experience	[3, 4]
1131	We evaluated the lesson together (as after each lesson) and my task was to always give him a plan for further graphics lessons by the end of the week.

3974	In this diary, I would like to address my latest experience. When explaining the task that the students had to complete, I had no idea how many times I would have to explain the instructions when preparing the lesson. It was in the sixth grade, in a more advanced group of English, where I assumed that the students were able to understand at most for the second time. Or at least the more talented. But unfortunately. I explained the instructions three times in English.

2336	What sounded good to me, different. What I would like to change and what to take over into my teaching. It was nostalgia! It was a great expectation! But it was also a great awakening!

3196	"I spent the first hour listening to ZSV in a second. I knew in advance that it was a bit of a wilder class, but I thought that my arrival should somehow calm down.

1328	I don't think it was wrong when I shouted at the boy. But was it right to give them the punishment they were to bring until the next lesson, and when does such a teacher usually give such punishments?

4247	They also tried to define what the will is and how it can help us achieve our life goals. . . In the end, everyone had one life goal he wanted to achieve. . . .

While dictating the minutes, I said to myself that next time I had to give them some other activity during the lesson than just reading from a textbook, writing, a worksheet, and listening to my explanation.

1229	I must say that both in the fifth and in the sixth and in the seventh I was pleasantly surprised - the students are relatively calm, smart and communicate.

I would be quite interested in what could be invented for them, when they are just beginners, the words will probably prevail there.

5081	Another thing I encountered was that the teacher forgot to give a dictation notebook to one boy, then invited him to work independently if he did not write the dictation. The boy claimed that he was writing the dictation, then the teacher found it and handed him the notebook. I missed the student a little, because it occurred to me that with her approach, the teacher built respect for the students and I lacked respect from the teacher towards the student.

852	I agree with this style of learning, so maybe it makes it difficult for me to accept this teacher's style. This teacher's style is aimed at teachers, not children.

2952	So I still don't know exactly what I think about marking, but I guess I don't like it. What instead? I'm just thinking. What I also appreciated, and what is beneficial to me, was the feedback the teacher gave me after each exit. We then had the opportunity to think about the hour from a different angle and think about what I could and wanted to do better.	What I also appreciated, and what is beneficial to me, was the feedback the teacher gave me after each exit.	Reflection	[2, 5]
4920	Therefore, they usually write tests, oral examinations are not common. I feel good about the teacher, she can really tell that she enjoys her work. I was surprised at the rumble at school. What I saw, but did not find out, the teacher did not have any free hours. She had been teaching since morning. I'll see how I can learn. We are preparing for laboratory work. Children will work in pairs, the topic will be filtration and crystallization.	What I saw, but did not find out, the teacher did not have any free hours.	Experience	[2, 2]
6908	The teacher always gave me a short feedback after class, which I really appreciate. What I've found so far: School is not a section. The fact that I have been working with children from Pioneer for 8 years does not mean that these children will be the same and that the same rules will work at school.	What I've found so far: School is not a section.	Learning	[3, 3]
2380	On the one hand, I was happy, on the other hand, I felt a great responsibility. What if I let them down, what if they expect more from me? The lesson went quite as I had planned.	What if I let them down?	Reflection	[4, 6]
5341	What if I don't know when he's tired and I'll overdo it? What if I disappoint not only him, but also his mom and the headmistress who offered me the job? What if he wants to put a scarecrow or a gecko on my hand? (I wish the bastard was full.) I usually prepare well for it.	What if he wants to put a scarecrow or a gecko on my hand?	Reflection	[4, 6]
969	This student also suffers from a certain disorder. So as soon as the test comes, he gets nervous and has a mistake in error. The final mark is therefore not very flattering. Is this fair, what if he had told me the information correctly the previous hour, and what if it wasn't the only information he knew in class that he wrote wrong in the test? Coincidentally, I noticed. Is it fair to him?	What if he had told me the information correctly the previous hour?	Reflection	[5, 5]
2448	What if he doesn't pass the comparative tests and can't progress to the sixth grade because of me? What if I screw it all up and explain something to him completely stupidly, what if I give him a lot of information, what if I give him little information? What if I don't know when he's tired and I'll overdo it?	What if I give him a lot of information?	Reflection	[4, 6]

5685	Horror, of course. Can I explain everything to him well? What if he doesn't understand it anyway, what if he doesn't pass the comparative tests and can't pass to the sixth grade because of me, and what if I screw it all up and explain something completely wrong to him?

1472	I was quite nervous because I had never taught in class before. At home, I tried several times to lead the class, but I still wasn't sure. What if someone asks something and I don't know, what if I explain something to them and they don't understand it from me? An hour ago, I was waiting in the hallway for my accompanying teacher.	What if someone asks something and I don't know?	Reflection	[6, 4]
4758	After class, I talked to the accompanying teacher. She confirmed to me that both students were violators of the class order. But what she told me afterwards shocked me quite a bit, and I must say that I felt a little bad. Both of the boy's parents are deaf, so he communicates at home only in sign language.	But what she told me afterwards shocked me quite a bit, and I must say that I felt a little bad.	Feeling	[7, 6]
4686	When I noticed how many teachers fill out papers and various forms, deal with reprimands, notes, prepare tests, modify them, so it is very difficult to find time for some invention of activities. What still seems difficult for me is to speak German to the students. I have tried it sometimes, but it is difficult when they are not used to it from my teacher.	What still seems difficult for me is to speak German to the students.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
6190	If they gave us some better, more practical tips or showed us a demonstration lesson, it wouldn't be bad at all. What I found funny at school and what I will never forget was a message from a classmate who didn't believe that the students didn't know where the north and south were. Then she recognized herself and admitted that I was right. I also have the first repair of papers and repairing about 30 papers is no walk through the rose garden.

5018	It took 30 to calculate BMI, and the poor teacher almost had a heart attack because she no longer knew how to explain to children how it counted. What I have to appreciate and I still have in my head is how optimistic, kind and smiling teachers are at this school. . . Personally, I would probably go crazy at that school, but they're fine.	What I have to appreciate and I still have in my head, how optimistic, kind and smiling teachers are at this school ...	Reflection	[5, 3]
320	I think that much more time should be devoted to art education so that students can fully express their creativity and not always just try to win the battle against time. What I must praise is the interconnection of art tasks with other subjects and the effort to outline historical styles or art techniques, despite the lack of time in class. I liked the connection between an art lesson where children discussed Gothic and tried to write with a quill like medieval monks with a history and civics lesson, where they talked about religion.

5067	Fulfilled. Now. . . Today, I would like to follow up on the last hour, when we talked about the underwater world. Do you remember all the pictures from the last hour?

What do you think the pictures had in common?	Other	[6, 7]
125	Everyone was watching me what I would do and how I would solve it. But the problem was that I was completely clueless. What should I do: He doesn't care about the note, he doesn't care about the five, he doesn't care about his parents. I have absolutely nothing for him.	What should I do?	Reflection	[4, 4]
2560	What about eight? There I rode the wave of my accompanying teacher and the German almost didn't come out of my mouth in an hour, because the brats don't really care. But what really surprised me was the marking system. During the last hour, I gave them a test to fix and mark. Well, I fixed it, but I didn't dare mark it for one simple reason.	But what really surprised me was the marking system.	Feeling	[5, 6]
7040	They will probably forget everything in a few moments, but it was nice to see at that moment that they enjoyed and were interested. But what pleased me the most: The teacher told me after class that I was better every hour. This gave me a new determination. Yes, I want to continue.	But what pleased me the most?	Reflection	[4, 5]
179	A certain advantage is that I know the school and the teachers, and some even taught me a few years ago. But what surprised me and actually still surprises today's students.	But what surprised me and actually still surprises today's students.	Feeling	[5, 5]
5428	He couldn't insert and use a single function, and instead of finding the correct notation (they could googlit), he rocked in his chair. But what surprised me was that my accompanying teacher told me the next week that my mother had written an e-mail to this particular student, that he did not agree with the mark. Pupils always have the opportunity to fix it within a week, but this student did not take advantage of it.	But what surprised me was that my accompanying teacher told me the next week that my mother had written an e-mail to this particular student, that he did not agree with the mark.	Feeling	[5, 4]
233	But what surprises me even more than the assistant's behavior is the students' reaction. They seem to have it on the hook and are completely fine with the assistant. Is it possible that no other ways of communication affect students?	But what surprises me even more than the assistant's behavior is the students' reaction.	Feeling	[4, 4]
5349	But what bothers me a lot more is that they do not prepare us for such situations at school. We have only one methodological course per semester, where they introduce us to some general principles. We will receive a diploma in English language teaching at primary school.	But what bothers me a lot more is that they do not prepare us for such situations at school.	Difficulty	[3, 6]
3079	I saw that Honza didn't make it even though he was trying. I tried to help him with the task, we got along quite well. But what struck me was that Honza made a meaningless 3 lines across the triangles about the third sketch of the triangle. I looked at it and had no idea what he meant. I tried to ask him, but I didn't get an answer.	But what struck me was that Honza made a meaningless 3 lines across the triangles about the third sketch of the triangle.	Feeling	[5, 3]
3019	I'm not saying I'm criticizing for everything, but I need to have some self-reflection so that I can move and improve. What surprised me a lot now in the second part of the practice was the ninth grade. I taught there for the first time and we made a generation gap. I expected them to disturb my class, to refuse to cooperate, and to have no respect.	What surprised me a lot now in the second part of the practice was the ninth grade.	Feeling	[6, 4]
4106	What struck me a lot was the approach of the teachers in both my didactics. Because this is a seminar on English, I will not comment on history and I will focus on the didactics of English.	What struck me a lot was the approach of the teachers in both my didactics.	Feeling	[5, 6]
1675	Anyway, even my arrival did not stop or silence them (nipple: great, Thursday 4th hour, my vocal cords are already fired, it will definitely be a very rewarding hour). What really surprised me was the interest with which they went to the board (nipple: so they didn't always hit the right one, but rather few people hit the right one - but that doesn't change how happy they were when I called them. He was it was a shock for me, because in the other classes no one wanted to go to the blackboard and at all that they would argue about who would go there first.

1947	The teacher promised me that she would show me the finally corrected and marked papers so that I could see how she finally did it, so I am really curious. What intrigued me this week are the children with autism at school, but the teachers have not received any training on how to work with them.	What else intrigued me this week?	Reflection	[4, 4]
248	But even though I enjoyed the work a lot, I'm not 100% convinced that I could do it in the long run. What discourages me is mainly the huge mental and physical demands - I each prepared late into the night and got up extremely early, so I was permanently exhausted. A lot of people tell me that this is only the case at the beginning, that then the teacher has things prepared from before and the preparation doesn't take that much time.	What discourages me is mainly the huge mental and physical demands - I each prepared late into the night and got up extremely early, so I was permanently exhausted.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
5657	Children are also more rude and afford more to teachers. What really surprised me is the number of assistants at school. There is an assistant in almost every class and at least three children with a disorder in each class.	What really surprised me is the number of assistants at school.	Feeling	[5, 4]
2735	I had no expectations. I wondered what awaited me. The school surprised me with a pleasant environment and a relatively young team of teachers. What pleasantly surprised me in class is that the students do not use mobile phones at all, even during breaks I did not notice that they used them. Pupils are actively involved in the lesson, teachers not only lead frontal classes, but civic education lessons are fun and rewarding, everyone is involved.

3823	"The teacher wrote a word on the board (it was ""Finn's adventure"" to repeat from the last lesson) and the children had to write as many words as possible, using the letters from the given word.

Sevens are very well versed in literary theory, they can use concepts in the analysis of the text, which I myself learned until graduation."	What pleasantly surprised me was the level of knowledge of the students.	Feeling	[5, 5]
3419	I would like to find some golden clash of all this in the future.

3573	And why will I write about the teacher? Because I like the way he teaches, not only how he teaches, but also how he relates to his work. What fascinated and surprised me a lot is how the teacher leads the students to independence and responsibility for their things. When a student writes a misspelling of a paper, it only depends on him whether he can correct it or not.

6502	And with that, I know it's definitely not good to go to class, but I don't know if I can get rid of it. What got me the most / surprised / amused so far is the yelling at students, I completely forgot that they are actually yelling at high school and it's suddenly really weird, after the experience from primary school and so on.	What got me the most / surprised / amused so far is the screaming of students!	Feeling	[6, 5]
6714	But the boy never reads, he is on the phone forever and his mother supports him in it and does not try in any way. What then, is it up to the teacher to save him? Probably not, but somehow to push him so that his results correspond to the 7th grade, the teacher must have. Which can be very strenuous.	What then?	Reflection	[3, 3]
7008	As far as children are concerned, so far they have all been golden, except for eights, but I expected that it probably won't go the way I paint. But I'm not saying it's their fault, I'm swimming in it, because I don't know how to work with them.

7073	In this case, the textbook is in a way a brake, mainly because the students do not own the textbook and I can hardly expect them to do homework.

But what I liked about the methodology lessons last semester is the communicative approach.	Feeling	[4, 4]
6846	So that I do not need six individual courses at the same time and in one place from one group course. But what comes to my mind when writing this diary is that if I want to continue with a communicative approach (or maybe any), I need to transfer at least part of the responsibility for what students learn to the students.

5396	In addition to the correct solution, the teacher requires the students to explain the given grammatical phenomenon. The teacher practices with the pupils the proverbial determination of developing adjectives.

2086	Each member of the team performs the task for himself. At the end of the round, we will correct the tasks together and count the points. The members of the winning team will get a number one.

1655	The implementing teacher has excellent lessons and I already know that I will definitely take something with them and use some activities for my teaching. What I really like is a certain tip of interpretation, which is largely left to the students and the teacher only coordinates it. For example, entering a few questions that they are looking for answers in an atlas. Pupils then mark the answers on the board and then make a joint entry from it.

7072	Unfortunately, I was limited by time, so there was no time left for any practical exercises or an interesting documentary, the skin system had to be discussed in one hour.

2284	As for the background, it occurred to me to show the children the graphic technique of decal, by folding the paper in half, so at the beginning of the lesson I explained to them what used graphics are and I brought some of my works and graphic matrices. I noticed that the children were very interested, they listened to me with gusto and did not have an absolute tendency to disturb.

6568	It is a perfect way for students to realize what the dessert consists of and they can then use this knowledge further. As for my own teaching, I was thrilled with how the students got involved, were active and tried. They answered questions, were able to work very well in groups, and overall I worked well with them.

3538	As for the ninth grade I teach, I met with slight resistance. In the sense that I may have been too demanding. The lesson was quite intense, as part of the class went on a trip and I taught three students (1 boy, two girls).	As for the ninth grade I teach, I met with slight resistance.	Difficulty	[6, 3]
3097	"At the same time, I tried to treat them the same way I always do. In short, to make the supervised class look exactly the same as I do without supervision.

6450	I think at first I will use good presentations for me. As for the OV hours, on the contrary, I was absolutely sure of those that surprised me.

6330	"My initial shock was replaced by a gradual habit of how it works at school, and I stopped being ""afraid"" to learn. Well, like whom. As for one group of eighth graders, it occurs to me that their lessons are ""in my heart"", they are very pleasant to learn there and I can work well with them, because their English is already at a relatively good communicative level and I feel what you do in class. I can and can't afford to say. But when I really sweated was when teaching third graders."

3883	In the end, the activities are too elaborate and a bit chaotic (it seems to me then). As for the pros of my learning, Ifka confirmed to me that I really smile during class (even though sometimes I die of fatigue inside or don't have the best day), which created a relaxed atmosphere and thus ideal conditions for learning English. I supported such an atmosphere with questions about students' privacy. One activity was based on true / false statements and thanks to it I learned more students.

5170	But not everything happened. We refrained a lot while writing partial dialogues.

4588	What it is, but the reality we would have to ask the students themselves - I hope it would match my feelings. As for the accompanying teacher, in the last lessons I noticed such small minor changes, but thanks to which it works much better in class - sometimes she walks around the class (although the main station is still behind the department), trying to involve students more in class, does not use when interpreting only a textbook, etc. I have probably already understood why the teacher is so measured, strict and still admonishes the pupils and does not even let them flap. It is a protection against indiscipline, the disintegration of the clock, chaos.

1115	As for the teaching itself, I would include even more work in groups in the classes, where students would work on smaller projects (creation of posters, presentations, etc.), which would then be presented by individual groups. I believe that frequent presentation in front of the class is very important for further study, students improve their communication skills and increase self-confidence.

3114	Which, by the way, I find very interesting, because these conversations usually look completely real - maybe they're really talking to someone. As far as art education is concerned, the creations of the students were, as I expected, very impressive. Due to a different flow of their thoughts and relationship to reality, their work differed from that of an intact individual.	As far as art education is concerned, the creations of the students were, as I expected, very impressive.	Reflection	[3, 3]
6985	Likewise, it is not easy to reassure students when working independently. So this is a challenge that I have a bit of a problem with so far. As for teaching history at this school, I have the opportunity to attend the classes of two teachers. So here's some comparison. Both teachers are energetic and very positive. but one of the teachers stopped me with her concept of teaching.

4114	It seems much better to me, because I feel that I can be closer to the children and it is easier to distribute my attention among such a smaller number of students. As for the thing that fascinated me in the last days of practice, it is definitely how the students in the class treat each other. There is one pupil in the class who is blind and therefore often needs help with, for example, orientation in the corridors, when moving to other classes, etc.	As for the thing that fascinated me in the last days of practice, it is definitely how the students in the class treat each other.

3293	However, if I think about it so thoroughly, it took more than 35 minutes and what was it? What actually happened in that hour of English? Did anything happen that would benefit the students?

6194	"The lesson was, of course, followed by a brief evaluation of the lesson with the teacher. What the hell was I supposed to say to her?

5625	So I tried to manipulate the ending somehow and it always went for a while and not for a while. I felt the class begin to have fun. What were they supposed to do when I wasn't paying attention to them and playing with a PC there, I thought, so we'll probably spend the rest of the hour like this. But no, in the end one of the students came to help me and the video finally started.	What should they do if I didn't pay attention to them and play with a PC there?	Reflection	[5, 6]

1320	Now I have taught another 2 hours and I feel a very slight improvement over the first ones. What I perceive as the main problem in practice is that I don't really know the children or the textbooks and the material they discuss in as much detail as I would need to create a functional lesson. I still walk around the class and try to make contact with the students in the back, but then we can't discuss the material.

2782	Since I spend an average of six hours a day in my tribal class, with a few exceptions, such a reflection becomes all the more difficult than if I taught an hour or two a day. However, what is worth mentioning is the way in which my colleague and I started teaching civics in 6th A. We decided to try tandem teaching, in which we complement and deepen each other's ideas. The best moment was probably a well-coordinated scene, which was to introduce the theme of the lesson - Conflict Situations.

6036	Maybe at the gymnasium, or with a class that I will teach longer and know how and if they work at all. She herself says that she doesn't wear anything extra there, she doesn't appreciate it. What this meant for me is that I can cough up some creativity and activities in this class. For the next lesson, I simply went to exercise from a textbook and a workbook.	What did this mean for me?	Reflection	[5, 5]
4275	The boy turned me on unbelievably, looked me in the eye from the back bench with a contemptuous grin, and just won. Damn. How about him? What to do, what to say, should I ignore him? I was picking up notebooks, and he handed in a piece of paper with letters randomly placed on it. It wasn't words, sentences, syllables, just letters.	What to say?	Reflection	[4, 5]
253	How is that even possible? Can't they really even open a textbook on their own? I'm pretty horrified. The thought comes to my mind that I would not want to teach such children. Couldn't they be motivated in some way, but how? The teacher comes to them, scrolls to the right page in the textbook. The boys are supposed to work on the project, but not a comma will be added to the paper in an hour.	Couldn't they be motivated in some way?	Reflection	[5, 5]

5479	Next: If someone completes the activity earlier, then give him another, some interesting work, or have him write something on the board, e.g. correct answers from behind the blackboard. Which unfortunately means a lot of planning and with the current schedule I have no choice but to prepare activities late for the evening. There was also one exercise in the textbook where it was not clear whether the children should first speak and then write (and vice versa).

1632	When I discussed it with the teacher, she told me that this student, as well as someone like him, already had about 40 notes, two hiding places and it was useless.

Which led me to think about what leverage we have for students.	Reflection	[5, 5]
213	Fortunately, it didn't bother me at all, so it was fine. After class, I received positive feedback from the accompanying teacher that he liked it.

According to him, it was long, which I realize in retrospect was that he was right.	Which made me very happy, because I was quite nervous before my first hour.	Feeling	[7, 7]
1799	What then? Is it up to the teacher to save him? Probably not, but somehow to push him so that his results correspond to the 7th grade, the teacher must have. Which can be very strenuous. After the exam period and Christmas time, our practice returned.	Which can be very strenuous.	Belief	[6, 4]

4816	In addition to those marks in natural history, it is no exception that pupils have a grade five, do a report or, if they have a grade five, they fail. Which, of course, doesn't solve anything, because you can only fail once in the first stage and once in the second stage.

174	After the lesson, the accompanying teacher told me that it was clear from the children that they at least enjoyed the introductory activity. Which will please.

4628	After every one hour I was very mentally exhausted. It was very strenuous. I also didn't like the students, they are almost never taught to work independently. Which will be partly a bad upbringing, partly a team, but also a way they are used to working at school. It probably suits the teacher, but I'm used to a different approach.

So they were careful to catch as much as possible and to spend as little as possible at home. We wrote the test for another hour. No one described or cheated in any way. Probably also because the pupils are used to the fact that for the last 5 minutes they have their portfolios at their disposal, from which they can copy everything.

4006	Once it even happened to me that the deputy mistaken the date of my internship and informed all the teachers that I would not go to the internship for one week. But I came to school, and the fifth-grade teacher told me not to be angry that I couldn't see her in class today because she didn't count on it. Later, we talked about it together, that he graduated from the first degree overall, but specifically music education like me, no.

7119	"Therefore, the teacher should think about never punishing the whole study group or class. This would again disrupt the relationships he had established in the classroom.

4197	There are already publications for almost every direction, so why not use it as valuable textbooks?

I can do it without a presentation. So began the interpretation. I tried to make contact with the students, I went around the class, I asked them.	Okay, I thought.	Other	[6, 5]
3738	I enjoy the practice a lot. I found out that it really makes a difference to teach individual grades. I'm quite struggling with the fact that I don't like teaching six. As such, the juveniles seem to me like first-grade children. It's a bit easier for sevens, but it's not getting interesting until it's eight.	I'm quite struggling with the fact that I don't like teaching six.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
4365	Subsequently, I returned to the whole situation several more times, but I am convinced that I did the best I could in the situation. My first class was waiting for me last week.

I was quite scared, as I had no experience with teaching yet.	Feeling	[6, 5]
2486	So I asked the teacher what was wrong with him, after which she told me that the boy had a mild form of autism. She explained to me how to deal with him roughly. I was quite sorry that no one told us in advance if any of the students required a specific approach. So I stood over the boy and kept forcing him to work, thinking he was just hanging out.

I was quite taken aback when the teacher told me that the child was not interested.	Feeling	[4, 4]
3623	This will probably be the most apt comparison. The teacher did not exaggerate. These children probably have absolutely no interest in learning something, they interrupt, scream, run their own business, do nothing during the lesson. Pretty hard sobering up for the first hour, well, I'll have to compare them. The theme of Clothes is interesting and can be worked out in many interesting ways. The teacher brought some supplementary materials, there was also work in groups.	Pretty hard sobering up for the first hour, well, I'll have to compare them.	Reflection	[3, 3]
70	When class was over, his assistant came to me and told me she had Asperger's Syndrome. That was all I still have no idea, if she wanted to tell me that I shouldn't have noticed him at all?

166	The student just grinned, turned, and slammed into the bench behind him. I kept my word, summoned it, but because he couldn't say a single planet in the solar system, he got five.

Sometimes this repetition eventually results in testing, so the student didn't even know he was being tested and everything was very relaxed.

1264	Rather, she forgot her habit. I had mixed feelings from the first hour. Although I managed to do everything I wanted, I think I seemed very rigid and machine. I hoped that the next 2 hours the next day I would do better. But I must say that I was quite burnt out of my eyes. The biggest problem was the time I stopped watching and then I didn't catch up.

6771	Then we got caught up in a new fabric, which I tried to bring to life with pictures from the Australian outback. The children worked hard for an hour and I really enjoyed the hour. I hope the 7th grade could have said the same. class. 6th grade I taught today's lesson myself and I personally consider the topic to be discussed to be quite complicated.

2829	The children already understand something, they are quite capable and independent. I also found out that I don't like teaching a citizen at all. But not at all.

While learning in both types of classes, I asked myself a lot of questions about integration.	I hope it's because I only had a citizen in sixth grade.	Feeling	[2, 2]
1845	And I realized that it is a pity that we do not have permanent access to the computer room, where we would have a lesson on GIS.

I hope that one day I will teach in a school where this possibility will be.	Feeling	[2, 6]
6872	And so I ask myself the question: So is the mistake on my side? Or is it because the pupils prepare very little for German lessons? I hope that at the end of the internship I will see some shift both for myself and for the pupils and I will learn the answer, for example. After every lesson I teach, my accompanying teacher tries to give me some feedback.

5882	Which led me to think about what leverage we have for students.

Sometimes they are angry with children for ""uselessness."" She learned that the class she was to teach was not in a good mood. According to the teacher, the children were ""unbearable"" in the last lesson. When my practicing teacher found out, she prepared test papers and questions. He calls it ""Standby""."	She learned that the class she was to teach was not in a good mood.	Other	[6, 4]
4172	The most surprising thing that happened to me at my school lately was this. I came to school as always. She came to the cabinet and there were two teachers sitting in the cabinet, both of whom are Czech. So that my practice is not always boring and the same, because my accompanying teacher has, for example, three equal hours in a row, so I go to the other teacher's classes.	She came to the cabinet and there were two teachers sitting in the cabinet, both of whom are Czech.	Other	[6, 5]
2468	When they arrived in class, their indiscipline was evident. I could watch the teacher react to her. I realized that there is a relatively thin line between when it makes sense to punish students with a test and when it is better to withdraw from a test. In this case, it occurred to me that the students realized and appreciated the goodwill of the teacher and tried to behave in a disciplined manner.

5163	Dramatization is also an excellent way to solve e.g. social or class problems and quarrels. The dramatization of songs in music education consists in the fact that students dramatize the lyrics of the song. We did a competition in which students had to play any song that everyone knows. Then we guessed what kind of song it was.	The dramatization of songs in music education consists in the fact that students dramatize the lyrics of the song.	Other	[6, 6]

460	It probably suits the teacher, but I'm used to a different approach. From my point of view, the students hardly keep their attention at all, they do not listen, they are very unfocused. The vast majority of them worked without a problem only if I directly supervised and controlled them. All they had to do was walk two meters away and they were already looking out the window or having fun. They paid very little attention to me, so I had to keep pushing them.	The vast majority of them worked without a problem only if I directly supervised and controlled them.	Experience	[5, 4]
4631	He is said to have logged in for the first time during this hour. I must say that although the student worked alone, he was among the first to complete the worksheet and seemed to understand the subject matter. The second and fourth lessons were at a science listening class. The second lesson was in class 6. B and the fourth in class 7. In 6th grade, they evaluated the test from the last lesson and discussed the questions in which the students made the most mistakes.	The second and fourth lessons were at a science listening class.	Experience	[6, 5]
1275	In the first lesson, I sang with the students and played on the body. They did the activity for the first time and said they liked it very much. I gave them the second lesson to write out from the textbook what we were supposed to discuss, with the proviso that in a week we would repeat everything with a presentation and show illustrative videos. So we'll see how many of us meet next week. Mr. Czech teacher also has the same teaching methods, only more involved in the interactive whiteboard. There is peace in his lessons.

3931	What I found difficult proved to be much more comfortable with the class. They already had the basics of physics and worked well together. In the second lesson, I taught redox reactions in ninth graders, and they didn't understand anything at all. I think it's not entirely my fault, because this topic already requires that he can name compounds and write down a chemical reaction, and they couldn't do that at all.	In the second lesson, I taught redox reactions in ninth graders, and they didn't understand anything at all.	Experience	[4, 5]
546	I realized that students get a little tired and need to change activities. At least I know next time how else to proceed. I left the classroom feeling good. The second lesson I taught music education to ninth graders. When I entered the classroom, I was horrified. Not only from the height of the students, but also from their views.

2224	So are there any classroom setting and enforcement techniques that are guaranteed to work? The second question I ask in connection with a given situation is how to get out of it. If, for whatever reason, we resort to roaring, how to deal with the situation? Should we then proceed as if nothing had happened?

1422	With the help of various games or questionnaires, I would find out what the relationships are in the classroom and what is happening there at all, and this could also help to clarify Lucca's complaints and problem. The second experience, which I often and fondly remember, is the teaching morning spent with class 8. B. Pupils in this class are quite noisy and I had the opportunity to be with them in math, Czech, geography, English and chemistry classes. There was a lot of noise in all the lessons, it was difficult to concentrate on the teacher's explanation and remember something from the lesson.

5156	I like her attitude towards students, but also her own learning. I think that the children seem to love her and respect her. The second hour took place at 8A. I also had this class in music today. Apparently she is quite talkative and likes to show off. The subject matter this time was the English Revolution.	The second hour took place at 8A.	Other	[6, 6]
780	History is taught by two certified teachers and they are also in the same cabinet. My accompanying teacher was also my history teacher and he already has extensive experience with teaching. My second colleague has only been teaching for a few years, but listening to her is also beneficial for me. In the last few days, I was listening in various years of the second grade, I also got a lesson in homeland studies in the fourth grade.

Two weeks ago, I went to substitute for ninth grade.	The second situation I encountered this semester is from the ninth grade.	Experience	[3, 2]

4885	I was not afraid of this class, ie the 3rd year of the 4-year grammar school. In addition, the professor is a class teacher of this third grader, so she knows them very well. The second class is a quarter, then 9th grade, and here she warned me that it would be a little different coffee. In short, puberty in full swing, children have it on the sausage, as they say.

I had high expectations of it. Pupils are disciplined, motivated to learn and respect the teacher. I expected the problem when preparing more challenging tasks for gifted students.

3162	This class and the atmosphere in the classroom didn't work well for me. The next day I went to my first observation in chemistry class.

The second interrogation took place in the classroom directly by the teacher on another day. the assignment was a bit austere, either by explaining, any theory, or by naming the technique itself. There were no examples or practically any attempt to get students for this topic.	The second interrogation took place in the classroom directly by the teacher on another day.	Other	[5, 6]

The children constantly praise me, my head teachers also praise me, and many students where I don't work constantly come to me to teach them as well.	The second problem probably concerns my popularity with students.	Difficulty	[5, 6]
4602	There should be various approvals in leadership, not just mathematics and physics. The second universe is geography, where it works differently.

2328	So far, I have become acquainted with the school premises, with teachers, with pupils and with timetables and some documents. I have also been a participant in several hearings of art education classes. My second field is special pedagogy, within this field I attend various classes where children have behavioral problems or have, for example, specific learning disabilities. Right at the beginning of my internship, I was surprised by a completely different approach of teachers than the one I had come across so far, and she was a little used to it.

Two students were drawing something in a notebook during the video, when I asked what they wanted, they didn't want to answer it and I didn't know how to react, so I just reprimanded them. I deliberately caused the crisis situation to let them know that I knew about their frustration. But then I couldn't close the situation to make them listen carefully.

5506	As soon as entering any of all classes, it was obvious at first glance how the meeting schedule had changed compared to last week. It can be said that no one was sitting alone and most of them were sitting in the area where the benches are connected and four students are sitting next to each other. Before the distribution itself, when they were told that there were two groups, almost all the students were surprised that there were two groups and it was clear that they were upset.

6425	It was a strange feeling. I don't like to be the center of attention, but when you have to teach, there is nothing left. I have to overcome that timidity and get used to it. Even if I don't teach at all, I think it's a good training for life. I helped a group of guys who didn't enjoy it much. They did nonsense at work and didn't work well with the paint.

The first would evaluate the creativity, creativity of the student, the second grammatical and punctuation errors, stylistic imperfections, etc. They need to be held accountable for their written text, explained to them that is why they learn difficult grammar so that they can write well whatever they want, and if they are unsure of a phenomenon, whether they look for it or replace it. others. In a literature class, they discussed the oldest Czech literature and read a sample of a church text.

It is true that some of them had to be helped a bit - to explain the technique, or to show it. However, when the teacher and the assistant walked around the students and held their hands with a sponge and dipped them in paint themselves, it was something incomprehensible to me.

So far probably the best experience.	It is unacceptable to me that the teacher has no time for anything between lessons.	Reflection	[5, 5]

7027	The first crucial factor is that German starts in the 6th grade and English in the 2nd grade. It is therefore likely that they will build a closer relationship with English. It is also their first foreign language, so I feel that they will put all their energy into learning all the words and various past and future tenses, and a few years later there is not much room left for German. The second factor is certainly the ubiquity of English. Various signs, games and series that are world-famous and so-called trendy, this is a huge motivation for children to learn English.

1305	But I'm not completely identified with that myself. After all, it is only an external motivation and I would like to ignite an internal motivation in the students. I still have to work on it. Unfortunately, I started the internship at a time when the students were waiting for MOT and then free due to the school-leaving exams, so they were not in danger of any test in the near future.	I still have to work on it.	Belief	[5, 4]
1358	Is 45 minutes really that little? I think, yes! That's why I'm mostly confused with myself. I still can't spread the energy into the lesson like my head teacher. I wish I could learn and plan such a beautiful lesson at the end of the internship. In order not to be just negative, I will describe the situation that I liked, surprised me.	I still can't spread the energy into the lesson like my head teacher.	Difficulty	[4, 3]
5816	Before the lesson starts, I say to myself that the students are still small, so they will be cute and kind. However, after the first few minutes, I find that it is exactly the opposite.	Before the lesson starts, I say to myself that the students are still small, so they will be cute and kind.	Reflection	[6, 2]
5786	The teacher shook his head, and I was almost shouting at the two students sitting by the window, their heads hollow like bamboo. I tell myself, is the problem in me? I still feel like an hour at which I've only been completely exhausted. It doesn't bother me. The teacher resigned and confided in the office that this pair of students were simply sitting in class and doing only what they wanted.	Even now, I feel from an hour in which I have only been completely exhausted from listening.	Feeling	[6, 6]
3372	Today, Friday, I taught for the first time. Right after the week, as the teacher said. Just four hours straight. Also, the three classes were seventh, so I actually did only two preparations. But even so, the preparation was really lengthy. It took me half a day to figure out what to do with the students to make sense.	Also, the three classes were seventh, so I actually did only two preparations.	Experience	[3, 4]
2031	I felt a little embarrassed. Next time, at least I'll ask her what class she goes to. Remember the name? So really don't want me to. Even before I left for the first hour, I experienced a rather strange moment in the history cabinet. A student who was absent in the first lesson (he was at the dentist) apparently arrived at the end of the lesson, I mean two minutes before the ringing.	Even before I left for the first hour, I experienced a rather strange moment in the history cabinet.	Experience	[5, 4]
5244	This time I started attending primary school on PÅemysl Square in Brno-Slatina. Unlike the previous school, I never attended this one. Maybe that's why I was a little more nervous than last time. Before I even stepped into the school door, there was a problem. I didn't know which entrance to enter the school.	Before I even stepped into the school door, there was a problem.	Difficulty	[4, 6]
7032	So I don't like it, can I do it? How could I take this class? I can't imagine teaching in such a class yet. Also, it's just listening, I'm calming down. Working in such a class strikes me as the work of a wildlife tamer. In practice, I continued in January after returning to the Czech Republic.	Also, it's just listening, I'm calming down.	Feeling	[1, 4]
2992	After the lesson, the accompanying teacher also told me that I should dictate the record and keep it for 15 minutes. I will practice it for the next hour. Otherwise, the feedback was positive again, which pleased me. I already knew the class from us at school, I replaced physics there a few times. So I know which students are more naughty and which are handy.	Otherwise, the feedback was positive again, which pleased me.	Feeling	[4, 5]
1558	"But in the case of a student who answered ""NO, NO NO!"" To a decent question three times in a row, I didn't know how to react. Otherwise, the lessons in the ninth grade are better and I work better with the class than with the seventh grade. In seventh grade, children are more divorced (which I wouldn't mind, because I have an understanding, it's their last lesson, plus civic education)."

6562	His paper, as nervous as it was, got stuck and was constantly used, according to the teacher, the so-called padding word. I really enjoyed my hour like this and I ran away terribly. Otherwise, nothing special really happened. What would interest me. It was repeated on quarterly papers and the next week the students wrote them. Next semester I would like to go to more literature, if the schedule allows it.	Otherwise, nothing special really happened.	Other	[6, 6]
1605	For example, include the activity at the beginning of the hour after the recurrence to catch the whole thing. Otherwise, the students were quite willing to engage in activities and communicate with me. Which definitely made my job a lot easier. Overall, I really liked the internship, it is also thanks to the nice teacher, who made the whole internship more pleasant for me.	Otherwise, the students were quite willing to engage in activities and communicate with me.	Experience	[1, 3]
6113	But I don't blame the teacher for that, she was nice. It's probably in those kids, in the team. I'm just used to a slightly different mentality of the students here from us. Elsewhere, I could also have a friendly discussion with the children, get acquainted somehow outside of classes, discuss free time and other things. Many students were also interested in something about me, where I came from, what my hobbies were. But it occurred to me in Brno that they were more of a joke and zero respect for me.	Elsewhere, I could also have a friendly discussion with the children, get acquainted somehow outside of classes, discuss free time and other things.	Experience	[4, 5]
1325	"I prepared the preparation for the lesson to be sure a week in advance, so my teacher and the accompanying teacher came up with a ""neutral topic"" such as repeating the previous material of the eighth grade. Other times I learn the topic of the lesson the day before I have to go to teach. It would be unthinkable for me to be ill at the moment. (I teach Thursdays from 8:00 and on Wednesday I have my school at the faculty until 18:40."	Other times I learn the topic of the lesson the day before I have to go to teach.	Experience	[4, 2]
289	There was a very nice atmosphere in the classroom. Like ninths and sevenths, they are obviously used to fully perceiving the teacher and her interpretation. It was a very pleasant hour. The situation was different in a class where two boys had an assigned assistant. The assistant was an older man with a very resonant voice, so although he tried to speak quietly to both boys, it was never quiet.

1176	Pupils and students often have some bad habits. For example, one of them licks every thing he takes in his hands and only then works with it. Some students speak vulgarly and others even talk to their imaginary friend. Which, by the way, I find very interesting, because these conversations usually look completely real - maybe they're really talking to someone.

I hope and firmly believe that this will continue to be the case. In this year's semester, I practice at two schools.	In other words, visiting the first practices did not deter me!	Feeling	[3, 4]
6315	Certainly not that I am a better teacher than the children are used to, I have no doubt about that. What I learned, and what this lesson brought me, was an even more significant confirmation of how bad it is for (traditional) Czech education.	Certainly not that I am a better teacher than the children are used to, I have no doubt about that.	Reflection	[5, 5]
1499	After all, I chose this profession, and in order to perform it well, I have to learn how it works and how to work as a teacher.	Already during the holidays I browsed through all possible Facebook pages for teachers (focused mainly on teaching English, not history, which disappointed me a bit - why are all advisory pages and pages with tips for all possible subjects, just not for history?	Other	[4, 5]
6811	I taught for the first time in 8th A, because before they always had a different program. I was no longer nervous and the children in the class were nice, they cooperated. However, the lesson was not completely ideal, it is probably none, something will always happen that the teacher did not plan. I had to improvise because the interactive whiteboard didn't work.	I was no longer nervous and the children in the class were nice, they cooperated.	Feeling	[5, 5]
6898	Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. . . On October 11, 2018, I was to start my first master's internship. For this practice, I chose Armenian Elementary School in Brno. I already felt a little nervous in advance, so on Tuesday I went to see for sure where the school is located and how it affects me from the outside. The school made a common impression on me (size, location). On the day I started my internship, I was very sympathetic to the director.

197	Some groups started working. First, they wrote out names from the fairy tale and formed characters according to the names. Already at this step, they slowed down a lot. Some of them couldn't draw the characters or they just weren't according to their ideas, so they kept erasing. But some worked really hard and the characters were great.	Already at this step, they slowed down a lot.	Other	[7, 5]	K
7108	Each class, even if it is the same year, is tuned differently, and if I have one preparation, I may not meet their needs. From the listings we noticed differences, see. Singing class, elemental class, etc. If the class is spontaneous, it is necessary to use more rhythmic elements and use these pupils with the potential. So I tried two variants.	From the listings we noticed differences, see.	Experience	[4, 3]

2938	Which I don't want at all. It is still possible to book a computer room, but I don't hope much about it, it is usually dismantled a week in advance. Yeah, overall, with that technique at this school, it bothers me. . . At school before, there was a data projector and a screen in the classroom. There is almost nothing here.	Yeah, overall, with that technique at this school, it bothers me ...	Feeling	[4, 5]
6628	You come to practice and the director is not present. I don't know why it actually amazes me. It occurs to me that directors do a little bit of what they want. Yeah, maybe they have really important things to do, like training and stuff. But I can say that it was actually possible, but the deputy was in charge of us anyway, and I could tell that he was a great person.

3829	However, I was partly under pressure because I had to learn a certain amount of material with the students and I tried to do it at the expense of any methods. But I'm glad that I could at least try something and I used some methods. I am a little annoyed by the approach of the teacher, who asked me one single question before each lesson, and that is whether I know everything.	But I'm glad that I could at least try something and I used some methods.	Feeling	[5, 4]
69	I hope I never experience this again. But I'm curious when the teacher comes next week, how they will treat her. I understand that they take substitution more as a free lesson, so I won't jump to conclusions yet.	But I'm curious when the teacher comes next week, how they will treat her.	Feeling	[4, 3]
1508	Unfortunately, both of the teachers were on an excursion, so I had to substitute for them. The seventh-year geographies were fine. But ninth-grade English was a complete disaster. I wanted to run out of class and not be a Miss Assistant, so I ran away. Even though I had had a few hours of listening with them before, they didn't even notice that I had come to class. Forcing them to do something was a superhuman task.	I wanted to run out of class and not be a Miss Assistant, so I ran away.	Feeling	[1, 3]
6459	Suddenly I wondered how short 45 minutes was. I don't know about the children, but the lesson escaped me very quickly. I'm quite surprised during the breaks in the cabinet. I always wondered how the teacher must be preparing for further classes or correcting tests during breaks. However, I must say that this is not the case at all.	I'm quite surprised during the breaks in the cabinet.	Feeling	[6, 6]
6793	And in the history of these two classes as well, as well as quarters, which are ninth graders.

I am one of three people in the seminar who have some experience as a teacher, but as the only one of the three people I am a regular student at the Department of English (the other two classmates are through lifelong learning). Whenever there are any practical things about learning, others often ask me questions. It started quite innocently, when judging the quality of textbooks.

Mostly, however, about solved examples. I am pleasantly surprised that the students take the help of each other as an automatic procedure, they give advice and explain. The teacher tolerates a certain level of noise, but twice during the lesson she asked the students to calm down. In one example, students found ""nothing to complain about."""

I'm at the same school as last semester and it's nice how the school staff treats you when they already know you.

4584	ENTRANCE TESTS. Rather, the repetition of the curriculum from the previous year. I'm looking forward to it. I'm curious. It's such a different feeling when writing such big tests.

Even more surprised that there were no 5 or 4 from the test.	I'm completely surprised.	Feeling	[6, 6]
4714	I think it's sometimes good to include a little English in German. In general, if a student does not know how to say German, he will say it in English.

I am really very happy that my wish from the last reflective diary has been fulfilled, that negative feelings will be replaced by positive ones again. The next day of practice was the complete opposite of what I described last time. It only confirmed to me in my previous opinion how much it depends on the current state of the person (teacher).

I am glad that the teacher avoids templates, but sometimes she allows or suggests using a mobile phone and looking for pictures on the Internet that the children redraw. This did not happen in 6A and it took a lot of effort and time to motivate children to work. The images were simplified, often without details, but more relaxed and distinctive.

3465	I am currently at a stage where I have almost completed my experience. And I have to say, it took me a while. I'm glad I'll have time to do things for my school again, because for most of the practice I only did what was really burning. I still don't understand where my accompanying teacher took the strength to teach. He's still in school, he doesn't have breaks and he doesn't even have time to have lunch or even go to the toilet.

2804	But I still believe that it will come in time. After all, I don't have a proper pedagogical basis, I spent my bachelor's studies at the Faculty of Arts. I only have a positive attitude towards teenagers and English. I'm sure I want to be a teacher, but I still don't know if I'm talented. I probably have a period when I attribute a certain failure as my mistake and I start looking for shortcomings in myself than in anyone else.

5531	Can I do it? I've never done that before. I'm not ready for that yet. These were my first thoughts that occurred to me at that moment, as they told me. I couldn't imagine being able to do it.

Difficulty	[6, 4]
1569	I chose the discussion because at the Faculty of Science they introduce us to the elements of dialogical teaching and I wanted to try this style in practice. I am also aware that the lessons were more theoretical than action.

I am also aware that the lessons were more theoretical than action.	Reflection	[5, 2]
133	This is either because the student thinks about himself that he cannot draw, he simply does not draw, or because he does not know how to proceed. I am aware that the class I mention is very numerous. There are about twenty-five students, which is not enough. So it is not in the teacher's power to pay as much attention to the work as they certainly deserve.	I am aware that the class I mention is very numerous.	Reflection	[4, 2]
5253	"Soon it will be two months that I spend x hours a day in elementary school. I'm satisfied. I'm still getting used to the (still for me) ""new regime"", but I'm satisfied. I am satisfied.

6410	See how the teacher does it with those students, focus more on it, on the individual activities and so on. I'm getting more and more nervous. It will probably be that it is getting closer and closer. I don't know what I'm nervous about, everyone says it's fine.	I'm getting more and more nervous.	Feeling	[6, 6]

2884	The teacher is able to combine the role of actor and expert in one person, which is more than desirable for a lively form of teaching the Czech language. I am very glad that she, in the imaginary role of a ferryman, got me out of the gloomy waters of pedagogical theory into the sphere of active practice and real teaching. I think that LipÅ¯vka Elementary School has a valuable expert in her person, a treasure that they should highly consider.

4557	The whole class doesn't really show it to me, but the part of the class that shows it to me is quite dominant in the class. I'm quite taken aback and sad because I always thought that my teaching personality could be my strong point. I definitely don't want to do anything that won't make me feel good, but on the other hand I want the students to really learn something.	I'm quite taken aback and sad because I always thought that my teaching personality could be my strong point.	Feeling	[6, 6]
3812	We go through the worksheets together, but there is still noise in the classroom. If I'm standing in front, they talk in the back. If the opposite is true, the situation is the same. I'm pretty nervous about the constant noise. I like order and peace. When it rings, I'm just finishing the last sentence, so my class worked out beautifully.	I'm pretty nervous about the constant noise.	Feeling	[6, 6]

6536	I have learned all the lessons in chemistry and in biology I have only the last two left after this week. I'm glad for that.

901	It's always such a good reward-compliment and it encourages me a little. I will work as an assistant here for another year, as I was offered an extension of the contract. I am very happy for that, because there is an excellent team and especially the management, which meets my needs with the university. I have taught 3 hours of English and I finally learned something meaningful after those 3 years of college!	I am very happy for that, because there is an excellent team and especially the management, which meets my needs with the university.	Feeling	[4, 5]
7095	A good teacher should be able to adapt the curriculum to his students. I practice in English at primary school. For the first time, I taught fifth and third grade students here. I am very happy for that, because I had experience with teaching English only to older children. I realized the importance of the interconnection of lessons, although in practice this is not entirely possible.	I am very happy for that, because I had experience with teaching English only to older children.	Feeling	[5, 5]
1028	But I think it will definitely meet us all. Although I wish it wasn't in such a large class. I am happy for the time spent in this class, it will certainly give me a lot of experience. When I was thinking about the lessons with my accompanying teacher, I somehow confirmed that I really want to teach.	I am happy for the time spent in this class, it will certainly give me a lot of experience.	Feeling	[5, 4]
220	But back to reality, the first hours of my teaching came. I'm used to standing in front of the class and teaching, but the feeling of being accompanied by an accompanying teacher is really uncomfortable. So I wonder what the point is, when we still have to plan the hour according to what they want.

5272	"We were kind of like a ""bad and good cop."" Otherwise, I think we complemented each other perfectly and we did the best we could. I am curious about other experiences.

I am curious about other experiences.	Feeling	[5, 5]
6995	Is the lesson poorly structured? Or is the teacher too kind to them and not giving them any remarks? I realize how much it depends on the teacher's approach and readiness to teach. I am curious to try my own civics lessons in this class, how students will behave and work together. At the moment, however, I'm not looking forward to it. Now I have the first week of teaching practice at one of the faculty schools in Brno - Bystrc.	I am curious to try my own civics lessons in this class, how students will behave and work together.	Feeling	[5, 4]
3483	Although the class is very spontaneous, I am glad that they are active in asking questions and there is no complete silence, as I imagined it would be. I wonder how the lesson will go next time with the preparation - it can also happen that in the end it will turn out worse than this spontaneous action. As stressful as it was, I'm definitely happy for the experience.

4381	"So far, my feelings from school are mixed. I wonder how the next lessons will go. I haven't ""caught up"" much yet and I'm curious how teachers and children will react to my own teaching."	I wonder how the next lessons will go.	Feeling	[6, 5]
4643	Then we will say what was good and what needs to be done differently and better next time. I wonder how it will continue and what it will see from a different perspective, as a future educator. The next lesson began again in a similar way to the previous one. At the beginning, the teacher expertly recalls the content of the last lesson and thus strengthens the overall continuity of the subject matter in the pupils.	I wonder how it will continue and what it will see from a different perspective, as a future educator.	Feeling	[5, 4]
3615	I wonder what other experiences will bring me further practice. In the week from October 22 to October 26, I completed another series of six hearings. It was a fifth, eighth and ninth grade English class.	I wonder what other experiences will bring me further practice.	Feeling	[6, 4]
1946	Those differences !! This is insanely visible. Some want and some do not. But what about that? How to change it. Or is he just showing off in front of me? See you in the next hours. I'm curious. The accompanying teacher tells me after class that it can be seen that the students showed that it would be better for the next few days. They have to get used to it.	I'm curious.	Feeling	[6, 5]
3260	They have to get used to it. Two days have passed and I'm going for it again. In all classes today we write the so-called ENTRANCE TESTS. Rather, the repetition of the curriculum from the previous year. I'm looking forward to it. I'm curious. It's such a different feeling when writing such big tests. The first hour - sevens. I'm completely surprised. After 30 minutes, they hand in the first thing they have done.	I'm curious.	Feeling	[4, 7]
3094	We are just people and sometimes we make mistakes and there is nothing to be ashamed of.

6334	Lessons learned from the lesson: I have to admit that although the weakest of the eights is said to have worked best with this group so far. Although they are slower and it seems to a person with my (zero) experience that he does not catch almost anything in 45 minutes, most of them still do not grumble. But one really has to be careful how one gives instructions - slowly, clearly, show everything clearly, check if they have understood, and possibly repeat in Czech.

688	It's definitely not the worst class at school, neither in terms of grades nor in terms of behavior. But they are also not among the better. They are still at an age when puberty has the main say and have no problem ignoring teachers.

5248	You must go through the gatehouse to enter school. As a trainee student, you need to take a name tag so that children know who they are honored with.

128	This is because, as an assistant, I often come to class before the bell rings, and it is customary for the class not to get up on my arrival or to greet me significantly. They're just used to being part of a class, but I'd say I don't have much authority over them. That's why I was pretty nervous before learning in this class.

3801	I told myself that the children did not know what they were interested in. If the teacher does not inspire them for the subject, the children usually do not inspire them on their own. So I wouldn't let myself be sold like that and I would try to motivate children and get excited about English. In a few years, they will blame themselves for learning English for so many years, and after that time they still can't do much. So I lacked the motivation and enthusiasm of the teacher.

5712	I felt very good about the lesson. It was obvious that the student was looking forward to the next lesson with me and that he enjoyed this style of teaching.

6175	It was a big plus for me, because I don't like it when someone pushes me into things and, on the contrary, it suits me when I can tell myself, for example, that I already want to teach. If I had to evaluate it, the practice brought me more and more that I felt more shabby and already knew a little bit about how to work with children, even if it's not always pink and there are moments when you think it's crazy, but that's part of it, I think.

But when the boy repeatedly interrupted and did not listen and did not do what to do, I threatened to write a note in his diary. It was obvious that the boy did not want to and seemed to calm down.

1116	A week ago I gave a great performance in the 9th B, because I went there relaxed, I didn't play anything, I was natural and the students appreciated it and fulfilled the assigned tasks. When the teacher plays something, what he is not, the pupils feel it and the waves sent by the teacher and the pupils do not connect and the lesson then has no grades and gradients and the teacher then just fights with the pupils for who is the boss here and catches a third of it what is planned. The teacher should always be himself and also be able to smile and joke so that students can see that he is also a person who has emotions.

3867	At the end of the lesson there was a short discussion and evaluation, which pleasantly surprised me. It's nice that if the lesson had no introduction and no motivation, then at least it had a conclusion. To sum it up, after the first five minutes of meeting the teacher, I thought that she was pretty good from the morning, and that he would probably be a nice pedant for the children. On the other hand, she pleasantly surprised me several times. We'll see what the next hours are like. What I didn't mention in the previous minutes is a nice collaboration with the head teacher.

Flexibility, information analysis, the ability to find correct information, partial versatility, simply everything so that children do not get lost in today's generation. Specifically, there is a great lack of cool textbooks for the subjects I can teach. If I look at the textbook of hot food recipes from RunÅ¡tuk, then at first glance I understand students who do not enjoy the subject of food technology.

1914	I'm still learning to recognize when to intervene and when to wait. From the approach of Mrs. M. KonvalinovÃ¡, I noticed that the strictness and consistency are positively welcomed by children.

I have noticed lily of the valley that the strictness and consistency are positively welcomed by children.	Experience	[3, 4]
3975	After the first round, one student spontaneously thought of turning this game into a doubles competition. That was the spice the game lacked, a challenge. Out-of-class conversations.

I have witnessed several conversations outside the classroom, in the teacher's office or in the hallway.	Out-of-class conversations.	Other	[5, 6]

1018	Nevertheless, when I led the lesson alone, the atmosphere in the classroom was different from when it was led by an accompanying teacher. Personality charm is an exceptional thing when two people do the same thing, it's not the same thing, and it depends on many different little things. The class worked together in my class, but it was much more lively.

4353	I didn't have the tests copied (the teacher always did that), so I had to dictate the sentences to them in a practice book or on paper. As always, we had groups A and B. The short test, which would normally take ten minutes, lasted for twenty minutes just by how difficult it was to force the students to do something. They were bolder than usual. However, the test was eventually written.	The short test, which would normally take ten minutes, lasted for twenty minutes just by how difficult it was to force the students to do something.

4207	Pupils in the classroom did not have a chance to focus 100% on the teacher's interpretation, unlike the previous classroom. In addition to her voice, she must also perceive in her class the voice of an assistant who is inadvertently distracting. I also felt another, unfortunately worse, atmosphere there.

In addition to the practice of my own approval, I also had the opportunity to try what it is like to be a teaching assistant in the first grade, specifically in the first grade, where I help a disabled boy.

7003	The children were abnormally good at this lesson - not in fear - only respecting her demand for decency, and when one of her peers broke it, they shouted at each other.

6211	However, I also had my own exercises set aside, and I think that language teaching is very lenient in these situations. It is possible to replace words with others, or even numbers and dates, and otherwise leave the exercise in principle as it was. You can play with the tongue.

5959	What I must praise is the interconnection of art tasks with other subjects and the effort to outline historical styles or art techniques, despite the lack of time in class. I liked the connection between an art lesson where children discussed Gothic and tried to write with a quill like medieval monks with a history and civics lesson, where they talked about religion.

Since these projects were created under her leadership, it was clear that she is very proud of the children and was very satisfied with the projects.

6609	In the second, general class, the new material was explained to the students, so I paid close attention to the teaching methods of the principal, who I thought did very well. I liked that he used a presentation and an interactive whiteboard for his lesson, which took care of the pupils' attention until the end of the lesson. It occurred to me that when I taught this class in 14 days, I would do it in a similarly fun way to keep the students entertained.

1403	For example, small marks and then a big one is created. In a Czech lesson, the teacher asks all the children. He wants them to figure it out for themselves. I liked that it was not a plain interpretation and the children just didn't listen to the teacher. On the other hand, the lesson was busy and the teacher was constantly admonishing someone.

1765	She was very lively. I really liked the approach of the teacher, who was kind, but at the same time could be strict and fair. One day I want to be just like her.

I like her attitude towards students, but also her own learning.	Feeling	[6, 5]
4427	I have no idea if anyone will ever explain to these students why he is being treated differently. Overall, there is a calm, pleasant atmosphere in the classroom. I like the teacher's intonation of the voice. When he notices the increased noise in the classroom, he lowers his voice and the students calm themselves to hear it. The whole lesson is conducted in frontal form.	I like the teacher's intonation of the voice.	Feeling	[5, 4]
3798	The girl disobeyed and remained seated. So her insistence had no weight and the teacher let it be. I like the teacher's relationship with the students and vice versa. There is good cooperation in teaching. I might just point out that the teacher shows a little strictness, otherwise the students will take teaching too democratically in the future.	I like the teacher's relationship with the students and vice versa.	Feeling	[4, 5]
3785	I must say that I was very pleased. My accompanying teacher is very nice and she is doing great with the boys. I like how he works with them and how he tries to attract them. He knows very well that the boys are handy, especially manually, so the Czech language can't appeal to them that much. It tries to make their lessons more enjoyable and does not overwhelm them with unnecessary information.	I like how he works with them and how he tries to attract them.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6961	And now seven. So far probably the best experience. How can there be such a huge difference between one grade level? I like how a teacher uses as many activities as possible.

I like how the teacher uses as many activities as possible.	Feeling	[5, 5]
310	Today it was very demanding, but again it brought me a little closer to the teaching profession. In math class today, the children counted quite nicely.

2193	The child would stop having fun collecting fives for constant distractions. During the lecture, the teacher writes a note on the board. I like that it's in points, it's concise and clear.

5333	The teacher invests a large part of the lesson in pedagogical activities. In the classroom, she tries to keep order and organize activities so that she adapts as much as possible to the needs of the students. I like that the accompanying teacher can solve problems with peace and does not shout at children. It is known that he has a sincere relationship with children and approaches his problems openly.

1232	So I ask, is it appropriate to start with English from the first grade? And what demands should be placed on such young children? They should only learn words, even though they do not encounter their written form, and when they get the same words in the third grade, it is as if they are learning them for the first time. But what bothers me a lot more is that they do not prepare us for such situations at school.

894	How big is the Sun? How many stars? What does it mean that men are from Mars and women are from Venus? Do women really find it harder?

1109	The last thing I'm becoming more and more aware of is that I'm gravitating towards older students, maybe high school students or even higher. Young children are great, they are very active in class and they enjoy learning, but I can afford more with older people, and especially I could focus not only on language but also on history and literature, which I missed all the time because of them in basic schools have virtually no time left. Time, as I found out, is a scarce commodity - 45 minutes is completely insufficient for languages ââif something is to be done in an hour.

2399	It took me half a day to figure out what to do with the students to make sense. Today I went to school with the idea that I could just do it somehow. It will be a mess at most, but somehow I will suffer in those hours and learn until next time. It was fine with sevens. Although it was interesting to watch one create one preparation for three classes, but in each it works a little differently.

In the meantime, I suggested that the teacher inform the students about the page of the citation. com and she told me: ""you will have you for the next hour and you will probably continue with those quotes so you can tell them that there is this possibility as well"".

3100	After only two hours, I found out that the structure of teaching is very similar in all classes. At the beginning, there are two papers. Pupils report on their favorite band or singer. In addition, the teacher encourages them to tell him their own opinion, why they like it, what brought them to the genre, etc. Then the teacher plays the song at the student's request. Which I find very nice. We will learn new knowledge in the field of music and in addition we will tune in to good music.

1672	Sure, she could. But is it really supposed to be a teaching about children sitting and bluntly describing what is in the presentation? So I don't think so. Apart from not giving students enough space to write a presentation, I also learned that I have an unpleasant voice. When she told me this, I had no idea how to react. I even thanked her for being surprised that he was telling me that I would try to work on it.

3941	I thought about it all day, it was still in my head. What could I have done differently in the morning? I guess I shouldn't have given them the test at all. I could put it off for another class, the teacher wouldn't mind so much, and I would rather do something together. On the other hand, I'm glad I experienced how difficult it can be to work with a class when there is a bad atmosphere. For 9.

2798	I'm completely surprised. After 30 minutes, they hand in the first thing they have done. Soon almost the whole class. Even more surprised that there were no 5 or 4 from the test.

478	"It reminds me that I've always wanted this. I wanted a job that would fulfill me, a job where I wouldn't know it was a job, but mainly a hobby. Could it be that? Did I make a good choice? As I think, the teacher interrupts me and says, âLenka, you have it in you. You just walk into the classroom and it's quiet. ""Thank you and I'm happy."	Could that be it?	Reflection	[4, 5]
4818	They didn't have to prepare extra, they took it home and maybe they looked at it. But they had support. From a natural conversation, it is difficult to print in advance what the students will take home. But they can take notes themselves. And that is the transfer of responsibility to them. All the time I saw only one person who brought a notebook where he wrote something.	But they can take notes themselves.	Other	[6, 5]
6851	I returned to one or two hours of listening to find out how far they had progressed with the curriculum, and then I began to teach normally again. I can judge that Geography caught my heart more, because it is clear that students also enjoy more than the Russian language. Russian is difficult for me due to the fact that not every student has the same level in a given year.

3125	I immediately learned that there was a boy in the class with an autism spectrum disorder and a girl with Down syndrome. Mrs. My worries have grown a little, but I don't know much about how to work with such students. The teacher reassured me that it was fine, but I was still nervous. But then I said to myself that one has to face the challenge.	My worries have grown a little, but I don't know much about how to work with such students.	Feeling	[4, 6]
2092	Working with time and estimating how long this or that activity really takes is a bit of a problem for me. My expectations sometimes differ from reality.

3572	I don't know if this problem can be solved with notes, some polka dots or punishments. It's a tricky round over and over again. But what do I want to write this record about?

6382	I definitely don't want to do anything that won't make me feel good, but on the other hand I want the students to really learn something.

I only have seconds for history, but it's an amazing lesson.	My practice continues at the grammar school in Blansko.	Experience	[4, 3]
160	I went to the event right after a week, ie. my second day at school. My accompanying teacher is of the opinion that I am at school from teaching, and only through practice do I know if I want to do it. The original plan of a five-minute activity for ninth-graders and a fifteen-minute activity for eighth-graders became two full lessons. I was alone unattended with the ninth graders.

3968	The next day I went to my first observation in chemistry class. There are 30 pupils in the 9th grade and it is a very noisy class.

5848	At the first follow-up, I found a shocking thing for me. However, the matter did not concern the behavior of the pupils. There may be a few more in the class, but they behave exactly the same. My accompanying civic education teacher informed me before the first hearing that I did not expect any miracles, that the students were undisciplined, for some that only threats of writing apply. After my previous experience, I expected that students do not have to be as careful as in other lessons. Some students see civic education as free entertainment.

4118	I realized how difficult work can be when a student does not speak Czech well. My first impressions were very mixed, because there are no science classrooms at school at all.

997	If I came up with this problem later, I would solve it differently. This situation prepared me for the fact that the teacher has to take everything into account. My first visit was in math class in the eighth grade with the deputy, because my accompanying teacher was ill. The deputy is an older teacher who, on the one hand, has respect in the classroom, on the other hand, it can be seen that the pupils do not like her.

7102	I sat on the last desk and just watched the teacher teach, how he communicated with the students and how they interacted with him. My first listening lesson took place at 8. A. The teacher did not introduce me, he started the lesson as if I were not there. Nobody asked who I was, they didn't look at me, they didn't whisper to each other, they weren't ashamed. Simply no reaction.	My first listening class took place at 8.A.	Experience	[5, 4]
2104	The teacher is also an expert in her field, she pays great attention to e.g. for the correct singing of pupils (even non-choirs), the correct posture, breathing technique, etc. In my opinion, my first self-taught music lesson (the first year of high school) turned out very well.

6825	And I think that is very important (perhaps more important) than the subject matter, because they cannot do without social relationships in life.

3108	I think that some activities entertained the children and especially did not do me any extreme boycotts and worked.

5699	I say to myself that the previous teaching of literature probably failed here, because it was clear that he could not interpret a literary text, it did not occur to them to think about it, to ask questions. Then my efforts were in vain, because they did not know what I wanted from them. In my opinion, literary education should be mainly about refining opinions, learning to interpret a text, thinking about it, asking questions. I'm wondering how to teach students.	Then my efforts were in vain, because they did not know what I wanted from them.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
419	I just sat and wondered how wonderful it is to have such an interesting topic in class.

5984	The reactions of the accompanying teachers were also positive, so I was very pleased. And I must say that I enjoyed it despite the initial fear and nervousness. I currently have three weeks of practice behind me.

2596	The most interesting, however, is his sarcastic humor, which he likes to use in class. He sometimes likes to forget about the students who report because he assumes a stupid question. Pupils' motivation for the subject is, but surprisingly high again. The style of exposing the topic is similarly interesting as the mentioned teacher Petr. He also teaches practical natural history in this class, which is a compulsory elective course.	Pupils' motivation for the subject is, but surprisingly high again.	Other	[5, 4]
5648	It is wonderful that in class he may never have to calm down by increasing or changing the volume of speech, or similar tricks. Pupils' motivation for the subject is relatively high.

4772	They also moved with these activities and movement around the classroom in the morning. The lesson came to me as very pleasant and beneficial for everyone involved.

6693	"However, I conclude from the students' behavior that they do not have full authority over the teacher. I wonder what it is.

1652	"Thanks to such a procedure, we have many expressions available (we just combine members) and, in addition, students perceive each member separately, so they are well-versed in the example, they have a structured one.

6579	Maybe I would solve it with a punishment for grades, right in class or after school, because I am of the opinion that if a pupil can take the punishment home, it is not a punishment for him. Maybe I would let him apologize to the girls in front of the whole class, he would be a little humiliated himself, the question is whether it would not disrupt the relationships in the class even more. At least I would make an entry in the class book about the situation in the class, or I would inform the class teacher. I managed the Czech language practice relatively quickly.

2542	It is true that under her supervision the children work as they should. I really have no idea what I would do in her situation. Maybe in the end I would take the same approach as her.

Maybe in the end I would take the same approach as her.	Reflection	[3, 5]
6237	So far, no one has complained, or at least not me, but when I compare my pace to that of the teacher, I'm somewhere else entirely. Maybe I should try to slow down sometime. . .

Maybe I should try to slow down sometime ...	Reflection	[6, 6]
2483	Maybe such situations, where the student is rude and the teacher ignores it, are happening to teachers today and every day. Maybe after those years I would behave the same and not insist so much on authority and respect. In this case, the educator may be a stone in the river that was sharp at first, but over time it is ground into a rounded pebble by the river.	Maybe after those years I would behave the same and not insist so much on authority and respect.	Reflection	[4, 5]
2356	And so in the end it wasn't so bad. But I would like to know when the tremor will pass me and when I will finally learn to tear them all down when needed.

Maybe I should set it as another goal and start working on it.	Reflection	[2, 3]
5903	They act as if the teacher is the biggest scum he's met. Maybe I could still understand it from the parents of the children. . . but directly from the students? Evidently they take over what they hear at home. In one class there is a boy with very problematic behavior, due to which the teacher has an assistant.	Maybe I would still understand it from the parents of the children ...	Reflection	[2, 5]
6935	There will definitely be many such situations and much worse. I am reconciled to this and determined to confront such problems. Maybe this failure of mine was just because I expected it to come, I just didn't expect it so soon. The school where I teach I combines teaching with Dalton elements of education.	Maybe this failure of mine was just because I expected it to come, I just didn't expect it so soon.	Reflection	[6, 6]
7113	Such gestures began to reassure me. I feel that I am no longer as scared of them as I was from the beginning. Maybe because of that, I'm also beginning to feel some confidence and a greater determination to start teaching in this class. It happened to me that day, but another thing I'm still thinking about now. It was at the end of the citizen's class at 9.	Maybe because of that, I'm also beginning to feel some confidence and a greater determination to start teaching in this class.	Feeling	[3, 6]
4237	Sometimes I wonder what these students will be like in 3 years. Will they change with the same noisy teenagers as the previous eighth graders? Somehow I may make a mistake comparing a math class with a health class. to health. After all, health education is such a looser subject where there is more space for discussion. But let's go back to 6. D.	Maybe I'm making a mistake comparing a math class with a health class.	Reflection	[5, 5]
2620	Overall, despite the difficulty of the material and the difficulty of preparation, teaching at a grammar school seems to me better than at a primary school. But maybe it's just given the specific situation I'm in or the specific situation and mood of the class I'm teaching. That it would be harder to work with another class. But what I noticed from listening to other professors in terms of the team, it looked similar everywhere in high school.

3197	He didn't care what the rest of the class did, he was in class for those who would be in physics. Maybe it's just my generalized view of the past, it is certain that I have kept this feeling of the clock in my memory to this day. From the teacher's point of view, it was a pragmatic decision - he did not bother those who did not burn for physics, and they did not bother him in return.	Maybe it's just my generalized view of the past, it is certain that I have kept this feeling of the clock in my memory to this day.	Feeling	[3, 5]
6022	Despite this shortcoming? however, I moved on thanks to the still prevailing positive and friendly atmosphere in the teaching staff. Perhaps it is also due to the representation of still well-tuned nuns and brothers among teachers. Finally, I can't help but mention the location of the aquariums with fish and the paddock for chinchillas in the corridors, after which not only the biologist will always beat his heart when he passes by.	Perhaps it is also due to the representation of still well-tuned nuns and brothers among teachers.	Other	[6, 6]
2209	I observe that with me too. Maybe it's because I have a younger brother and therefore I know how to work with such students, I'm closer to them. That's why I'm afraid of what 9th grade, for example, will probably teach. I'm not lucky in this practice, and I'm actually a little happy about it.

Difficulty	[6, 4]
4359	I tried to lead them to divided work in a non-directive form. I'm not a very leading type, I don't like to command anyone, so I tried to influence them as I felt. Maybe I was a little tough and many would blame me for my lax attitude. When I saw that they were poisoned, I gave their divided work to other girls.	Maybe I was a little tough and many would blame me for my lax attitude.	Reflection	[6, 4]
5474	Mrs. teacherooo, I can't do it, I can't do it, my hand hurts. All this was heard in class. Maybe I could give bananas power to all the students. I didn't think it was such a horror, they just wanted to talk and felt a little muscle that they don't normally use. Of course, I didn't tell them this and I could tell them.	Maybe I could give bananas power to all the students.	Reflection	[3, 5]
1956	Otherwise, the lesson was similar. The students were active and seemed to enjoy the topic. Maybe if there was a bigger subsidy for R&D lessons, it would be better. However, in the seventh grades there is only one hour of VV, so you have to choose most of the activities that can be completed in one hour.	Maybe if there was a bigger subsidy for R&D lessons, it would be better.	Belief	[4, 2]
5999	The whole situation has been resolved. But how was I supposed to know where they were? And why didn't the teacher, who took the sevens out of nowhere, communicate with me, perhaps considering me their classmate. . . hard to say. . . It turned out well, but I still felt that I had failed and I am an incompetent teacher.	Maybe she considered me their classmate ... hard to say ...	Reflection	[3, 4]
130	But the question is what to do in this case. Let the girl rest if she doesn't have a note written, or force her to be active? I still have to think about that. Maybe I'll ask the assistant if she could pay a little attention to her and check that she has at least a written record. But the next time I see that she's so sleepy, I'll give her more peace and I won't reprimand her. It's probably not easy and I don't want to make it harder for her.	Maybe I'll ask the assistant if she could pay a little attention to her and check that she has at least a written record.	Reflection	[4, 2]	K
7065	It struck me that she didn't even explain to the students what topic to draw. She just said they would draw chess and that was it. No motivation. Maybe that's why the students don't like it. During class, I sometimes walked among the children to see how they were doing.	Maybe that's why the students don't like it.	Reflection	[5, 3]
2475	Which is actually something I wanted to elaborate on more. It seemed to me that the teacher warned the children too much about the shortcomings, and on the contrary, she did not comment at all on the successful work. Maybe because in these cases she had nothing to complain about the students. Although I don't think the quality of the images is any different.	Maybe because in these cases she had nothing to complain about the students.	Other	[6, 4]
217	Maybe letting him sit where he wanted made him feel relaxed. And maybe he just wants to know that someone is interested in his opinion.

Maybe in time I will figure out how to ventilate these experiences.	Reflection	[5, 5]
1252	But back to 7. And where I went to history this time. At the beginning, I assigned several tasks and tried to try two individuals (for the first time).

Since October 1 last year, I have been working at the Brno Primary School, ÅehoÅova 3, po (hereinafter referred to as the ""Primary School"") as a teacher's assistant in the seventh grade. My direct assistance is 25 hours / week."	Maybe in a while I will be able to answer this question myself.	Reflection	[6, 3]
4200	Maybe it was also because I knew that I was going to teach sevens, who are rather a noisier class, and especially their class is very small and the students sit there quite tight (there are no places available).	Maybe it was also because I knew that I was going to teach sevens, who are rather a noisier class, and especially their class is very small and the students sit there quite tight (there are no places available).	Reflection	[6, 3]
2973	Maybe that's also the reason why a lot of intern students realize that they never really want to learn in their lives and unfortunately leave this profession. However, the reality is quite different from what we see in the practices themselves. Society, in which teachers do not have much of a rosy position, also plays a big role in this situation.	Maybe that's also the reason why a lot of intern students realize that they never really want to learn in their lives and unfortunately leave this profession.	Reflection	[5, 3]
3328	But I don't know - I don't see their heads?). I don't know, maybe he just saddled the subject. Maybe he was spoken from the cabinet. Maybe letting him sit where he wanted made him feel relaxed. And maybe he just wants to know that someone is interested in his opinion. Maybe it was because of his opinion that he was in the office.	Maybe letting him sit where he wanted made him feel relaxed.	Reflection	[6, 3]
2431	I immediately realized that he was constantly talking, probably because school was the only place where he had the opportunity to talk to someone. I was sorry I thought he was rude. Maybe it's a bit, but he was definitely just trying to make contact. Disruptive, but I can't blame him. I kept coming back to how he repeated and commented on everything I said.	Maybe it's a bit, but he was definitely just trying to make contact.	Other	[5, 6]
6950	Before that, the competition was evaluated and other unusual things were solved. Maybe she did her own group work and my position in the class is not strong enough. Still, some of the work looks promising and I wonder how the kids will finish it. I'll see how it goes in the next few hours.	Maybe she did her own group work and my position in the class is not strong enough.	Reflection	[5, 5]
4481	It is right to do that I can't see it and continue or it is right to punish the student, e.g. Confiscating the test and giving it a five may be a trivial question, but what is the acceptable response to the teacher's copying, because my accompanying teacher preferred not to see it and continued to correct previous papers, which did not seem right to me.	Maybe it's a trivial question, but what's the acceptable response to copying on the part of the teacher?	Reflection	[6, 5]
211	Because I'm scared and I still can't imagine how to deal with these unfavorable situations and I don't have the opportunity to try out the individual procedures. Maybe if such a situation occurred, I would already be eliminating some inappropriate practices that I should avoid in the future. . . I teach English in the first grade. Children only have an hour a week and learn English exclusively by speaking, no writing or reading (because they can't even write or read Czech).	Maybe, if such a situation occurred, I would already be eliminating some inappropriate procedures, which I should avoid in the future ...	Reflection	[4, 4]	K
5904	I kept coming back to how he repeated and commented on everything I said. I thought I'd try to call him out more often next time and give him a chance to talk. Maybe he'll be happy and not shout so much. Anyway, it's worth a try. As I continued to think about it, I realized that he was always talking about the subject.	Maybe he'll be happy and not shout so much.	Reflection	[3, 3]	K
2851	So I don't know if I enjoy it at all. I thought so, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a class. Now I went to teach a subject, for which students are divided into 3 groups, because there are 33 of them in the year.	Maybe it's a class.	Reflection	[3, 4]
5314	I myself don't know how to put it in words so that others can understand me. Maybe I'm too hypersensitive. Maybe it's wrong and maybe it's not. I don't know. .	Maybe I'm too hypersensitive.	Feeling	[3, 6]
1221	Despite all these situations, however, the teaching takes place calmly and there is no major disturbance. Maybe such situations, where the student is rude and the teacher ignores it, are happening to teachers today and every day. Maybe after those years I would behave the same and not insist so much on authority and respect.	Maybe such situations, where the student is rude and the teacher ignores it, are happening to teachers today and every day.	Reflection	[4, 3]
1327	For example, only in terms of teaching workshops at elementary schools. For me personally, it needs to be far motivating when such a subject will be in charge of a man and not a woman. It may sound a bit selfish to some, but I'm not the one who doesn't recognize women in some way or tries to box them in some way, not at all. I just think that something is better for a man and something else for a woman.

3215	I have met the requirements for practice, the number of hours spent at school (I think I was still there beyond that) and I also have learned a little. I'm sorry I didn't get to more classes. I taught especially in the 8th B, where I probably worked best with the students.	I'm sorry I didn't get to more classes.	Feeling	[5, 6]
2382	Some caught on, but some worried me with their bored expression. But I was satisfied that I managed to provoke some activity in the students with various questions and tasks. I'm sorry we didn't make it to the final secret, which I had ready to repeat. Respectively, we caught up with half. But time was not enough for me even in the second hour. There, however, we were delayed by the introductory photo shoot and rehearsal of one student.	I'm sorry we didn't make it to the final secret, which I had ready to repeat.	Feeling	[5, 5]
3837	I also corrected and marked the test. It turned out roughly as I expected. I am sorry that students are usually better at memorizing exercises than at thinking. My goal for the future is for students to be able to apply their knowledge in practice, they do not have to remember a large number of facts.	I am sorry that students are usually better at memorizing exercises than at thinking.	Feeling	[6, 6]
4903	She starts swinging on the chair and I am very curious about the teacher's reaction. At first he doesn't seem to notice, but after a while he puts a movement game into the class. It must be difficult to correct the behavior of so many students and at the same time notice such small inconspicuous signs. This class I just watched the work in the classroom and I think that teaching this teacher, although in a frontal way, was not monotonous at all.	It must be difficult to correct the behavior of so many students and at the same time notice such small inconspicuous signs.	Belief	[2, 6]
5440	It is also a class full of students with disciplinary problems, you know it in that class. There must be a seat, but there is still a lot of traffic.

6000	Nine-year-olds are already reasonable people who more or less know what they want. It occurs to me that there is better communication with them. While children in seventh grade are more divorced. But I must say that I still enjoy learning. I am happy for the opportunity to attend this internship, as this internship gives me a lot. I gain experience that I would not gain only by studying at university.	But I must say that I still enjoy learning.	Feeling	[5, 5]
1627	Although I managed to do everything I wanted, I think I seemed very rigid and machine. I hoped that the next 2 hours the next day I would do better. But I must say that I was quite burnt out of my eyes. The biggest problem was the time I stopped watching and then I didn't catch up.	But I must say that I was quite burnt out of my eyes.	Belief	[6, 5]
3495	Unfortunately, I couldn't communicate with him, so I just handed out the sheets and he was already entering and checking the sheets. Next time, I have to work on better communication with the teacher and also overcome my fear of proposing something. I took a small step to do so when I offered to work out this quiz for 6th grade.	Next time, I have to work on better communication with the teacher and also overcome my fear of proposing something.	Intention	[4, 5]
1140	My experience is almost over. There are so many things to watch out for that it always comes to me that it has always failed more than it has. I need to have a better overview and accept the fact that it is a long-distance run. It happened to me that I taught for two hours - one of which I thought would be fine and the other that they would be tormented.	I need to have a better overview and accept the fact that it is a long-distance run.	Belief	[4, 3]
571	I know we all have a problem with labeling, but we need to be aware of it and try to avoid it. I really have to pay tribute to my accompanying teacher - it's the complete opposite of the teacher I had in my previous internship - he's older, likes to use a textbook, and overall he's not quite a fan of that free learning. But I have found that every teacher is special in some way. I don't understand that I didn't respect her more as a student. I can see it completely now.

Reflection	[4, 3]
2220	And I taught mostly here. I didn't really deal much with grammar, the main exception was a word stress / sentence melody. I have to reckon with the fact that as I let the children think for themselves, everything will take them much longer, so I need two for what can be done in one lesson.

3016	Although we are constantly trying to come up with new activities for them and using activation methods, we still do not achieve any results and most of the time they just give us blank paper. I must admit that it is very demotivating and it bothers me when the intelligent class I have always looked forward to at the end of the lesson tells me on any topic that it is boring, it does not interest them and they will not do that the only thing you they are willing to make them watch a movie. In environmental education, we discuss topics such as ozone, drought in the Czech Republic, plastics in the oceans.

758	And I also like Mrs. Dressler that she communicates a lot with the students and is directly against them. I have to admit that the teacher inspired me in this and I think that even with her behavior she gave me a lot of courage to stand up in front of the class like this. I started my internship this year at the GajdoÅ¡ov primary school in Brno. After this semester I will attend class 8.	I have to admit that the teacher inspired me in this and I think that even with her behavior she gave me a lot of courage to stand up in front of the class like this.	Reflection	[5, 6]
3143	I felt pretty bad because I didn't anticipate it at all, nor did I know what they were doing and what they weren't doing, so my own class was completely improvised. I have to say self-critically that it had no structure at all, we were just analyzing the sentences on the board. (I summoned the students and dealt with the sentences one by one.) I didn't feel completely bad about the lesson, but I wasn't particularly good either.	I have to say self-critically that it had no structure at all, we were just analyzing the sentences on the board.	Reflection	[4, 6]
1757	Those students who are there have to go through primary school, even if they don't know enough about the knowledge and what they have to know, that's 4. I have to pay more attention to time and adherence to the plan. It happened to me at the first teaching that I did not catch what I had prepared. At the second hour, I was more careful and it was better.	I need to pay more attention to time and adherence to the plan.	Intention	[6, 3]
3948	So I was curious what a difference I would notice, or whether the internship at the faculty school has any special advantages, positives and what better it can bring me. I must admit that the internship at the faculty school has so far given me much more than the internship in the last semester, and I have completed this here so far, only a few hearings and taught only 3 hours. At the previous school, I mainly lacked the possibility of teaching in tandem, while at the current school, we started with this form of teaching right after the introductory follow-ups in the individual classes.

4094	Soon almost the whole class. Even more surprised that there were no 5 or 4 from the test. I could peek into the tests. They are really good. I have to prepare my lessons pretty well. It must be fun! And now for both nines. I'm looking forward to you. But rather on how they take the test.	I have to prepare my lessons pretty well.	Intention	[5, 4]
2036	But I'm fine here. I hope it stays that way after my lessons. I have to admit to myself that I didn't do it a bit on Monday. I misunderstood the schedule, and I realized that I should be listening to Teacher Ress at nine in five minutes.	I have to admit to myself that I didn't do it a bit on Monday.	Reflection	[6, 4]
1075	In addition, the boy seemed to have read only the first half, as he did not even catch the action by the end. I have to agree that HonzÃ­k's journey really isn't reading for a child aged 13-14. But the boy never reads, he is on the phone forever and his mother supports him in it and does not try in any way. What then? Is it up to the teacher to save him?	I have to agree that HonzÃ­k's journey really isn't reading for a child aged 13-14.	Belief	[4, 4]
2592	But it still makes me wonder how such a huge respect and maybe even fear for a person you value at the same time will arise, and it can motivate you to such an unpopular subject. I have to figure it out. Another thing I noticed was the interesting work of the principal with a voice that seemed to lead the whole class.	I have to figure it out.	Other	[5, 4]

4050	Since they often have a gym with me and I'm relatively young, I sometimes convince them to work for me at least.

1750	But it could not be avoided, the class teacher was waiting for it. Then it was hard to calm the children down again and get them to work. However, I must admit that they started cleaning up on time and it was a joy at the end of class on Friday. A nice experience for me, which the children were able to conjure even from such a proven rather uninteresting traditional theme. At school, I already feel a little better than at the beginning.	However, I must admit that they started cleaning up on time and it was a joy at the end of class on Friday.	Reflection	[5, 2]
2267	At the time I was writing this diary, I had only spent a relatively short time in practice. I am just getting to know the school, the teacher and the pupils. However, I must say that I like the school, it has a pleasant environment. School facilities and facilities provided to teachers are also of a good standard. At Sirotkov Elementary School, so far I have been mostly just following.	However, I must say that I like the school, it has a pleasant environment.	Feeling	[4, 5]
2335	I'm quite surprised during the breaks in the cabinet. I always wondered how the teacher must be preparing for further classes or correcting tests during breaks.

I must mention that so far I am very lucky in the internships for accompanying teachers.

6329	I tried to captivate pupils in German with small interactive videos, with the help of which we discussed the simplest German phrases - dating, greetings, etc. I must say that I expected more success, because I know that they are not very used to it with their teacher, they are more dedicated to frontal teaching with the help of paper aids. They still couldn't keep their attention, and I'm not even talking about the subsequent game I prepared for them.

I must say that I was surprised when most of the children came to class really ready because they the teacher promised that they would use the mobile application again if they controlled the substance. to learn. The lesson seemed dynamic to me, mainly due to the fact that the teacher alternated different activities and the children were really drawn into the fabric.

Feeling	[3, 3]
2711	That's why I think that when we have practice for a long time, then we really know what it's like. I must say that during the class I was finally so nervous and a little clueless that after class I realized how little English I used in class. I always tried to give instructions in English and when necessary, I explained it to them in Czech as well. Otherwise, nothing much.	I must say that during the class I was finally so nervous and a little clueless that after class I realized how little English I used in class.	Feeling	[6, 4]
6992	I must say that I perceive it as a great experience that when I went to my accompanying teacher for listening, she deliberately performed all the possible activities with the students so that I could see it live and then I could try it too. I haven't known a lot of those activities so far and it's great to repeat and the kids enjoy it (they put together laminated cards, they play special historical bingo).

2750	During this internship, it was impossible for me to remember the faces and names of the students, because I went to classes of all grades. I must say that at the beginning of the internship I expected the students to be more disciplined. That didn't happen (maybe because I chose a school in the center of Brno), but I'm glad I was able to know the reality.	I must say that at the beginning of the internship I expected the students to be more disciplined.	Reflection	[3, 5]
3877	During the year, however, there are various trips, excursions, theaters, etc. The teaching is decided in such a way that, for example, one class is three days behind. I must say that at the beginning of the week I had problems with what class I discussed with. Sometimes I didn't even have time to write notes where we ended up counting, because I had to run to watch after the bell rang.	I must say that at the beginning of the week I had problems with what class I discussed with.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
1889	Yes, you won't meet them in the hallway other than with a mobile phone in hand, but when it comes to teaching, mobile phones are honestly in bags. I must say that I am really happy to study languages, so I will always have, with a few exceptions, only half a class in class. This can be fixed in some way, I did not encounter any problems in an English or French class.

3544	My practice is coming to an end. I taught the last lessons all by myself. I have to say I felt good, hour after hour. Some hours I had more prepared, some less. It also depended on how we and the students enjoyed the lesson.	I have to say I felt good, hour after hour.	Feeling	[4, 6]
5856	So my first teaching at the elementary school is behind me! I must say that I was quite scared, given the various comments on the teacher's lesson and my own unprofessionalism.

I must say that I was quite scared, given the various comments on the teacher's lesson and my own unprofessionalism.	Feeling	[6, 4]
3712	I taught for the first time. 6th year - Moon, 7th year - world agriculture. I have to say that I didn't do very well. . .

445	The teacher did not lose the classes for about ten minutes, coincidentally the classroom. After this time, the breathless colleague of the mentioned missing cantor, who also teaches mathematics, ran out, her second field is geography. I must say that I really admire the way in which the teacher managed the lesson improvised. First, she asked students if they would rather count or geography. The answer was geography.	I must say that I really admire the way in which the teacher managed the lesson improvised.	Reflection	[5, 5]
2138	I must say that the feelings are good so far. The first day of practice, I calmed down a bit when I went to introduce myself to the school management in person. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by how the management and teachers in the classroom treated me. Everyone was nice, helpful. And most importantly - I didn't feel like I was bothering anyone here.	I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by how the management and teachers in the classroom treated me.	Feeling	[3, 4]
2796	Both of my accompanying teachers reassured me that I was not at all afraid that nothing was happening. That I can definitely do it. Then they began to remember that they also had the nerve to practice. I have to say, it calmed me down a bit. And the teaching itself? Except for one class that had more fun and unfortunately I didn't know how to do it so they wouldn't have fun all the time. It turned out better than I expected.	I have to say, it calmed me down a bit.	Reflection	[2, 5]
634	It was very pleasant and after the presentation they wanted to applaud me, but the teacher told them that they would not applaud until the end of the two-hour session. I must say that my goal, which I set at the beginning of the internship, was probably met. I formulated the goal to learn to be a natural authority and to motivate students naturally.	I must say that my goal, which I set at the beginning of the internship, was probably met.	Reflection	[4, 7]
7128	B, where I worked with the students probably the best. For example, sometime in May I plan to go and see at least the listening to the 6th grade, where I didn't get at all. I have to say that my motivation has improved again since the last newspaper and I did better overall. I think that some activities entertained the children and especially did not do me any extreme boycotts and worked.

1611	Now the first days spent in practice at primary school are behind me. I must say that the feelings are good so far. The first day of practice, I calmed down a bit when I went to introduce myself to the school management in person.	I must say that the feelings are good so far.	Feeling	[5, 5]
6371	For example, health education is taught three times a week and to make it even harder, students always have some excursions, sports events or holidays. I have to say that the practice this semester really gives me a hard time. 10. 10. 2018 - This day I was in practice during the week when the workshops did not take place, so I had the opportunity to look into cooking classes.	I have to say that the practice this semester really gives me a hard time.	Difficulty	[3, 3]
2746	As part of my bachelor's studies, I already had the opportunity to look at this school as part of listening and I wanted to have the opportunity to try to teach here as well. I must say that the internship that was allowed to me at this school is about something completely different than before. After my pedagogical practice within the bachelor's study, I was firmly convinced that I would not practice the teaching profession in any case.	I must say that the internship that was allowed to me at this school is about something completely different than before.	Reflection	[5, 5]
6566	Three or four tasks were counted on the board as needed. I gave one for all the exercises in the notebook. I have to say it worked quite well. But I'm not completely identified with that myself. After all, it is only an external motivation and I would like to ignite an internal motivation in the students.	I have to say it worked quite well.	Reflection	[6, 4]
5607	During the internship I get into 6 different classes. One of those classes is class 8. A.. . I have to say that class 8. And it's really exceptional. This class is very busy, many students still do not understand how they should behave at school, etc.	I must say that class 8.A is really exceptional.	Reflection	[3, 2]
3595	Then the class ended. I can't say what caused the boy's restlessness. However, almost immediately I wondered if the assistant's behavior played a role. I must say that in the first half of the hour the boy got into a very unpleasant situation. He couldn't feel safe in class at all, so I wouldn't be surprised if his later behavior was the result of this situation.	I must say that in the first half of the hour the boy got into a very unpleasant situation.	Other	[5, 5]
4527	They are also children who need the help of a teacher more than others, and it is up to the teacher how to deal with such a situation and manage it. I must say that I very much admire the teaching staff from Merhaut, because the situations they face on a daily basis, not only in class but also during breaks, would certainly be very demotivating for many teachers. I have completed my first lessons and some of the impressions are exactly as I expected.

6385	I also set myself as the main goal during this practice to find out what the teacher does to create such an atmosphere. I must say that while I am looking forward to learning history lessons and plan to try a few tens of hours of tandem teaching before individual lessons, I perceive civics lessons as something I only have to complete to recognize my internship. history to one hour of civic education per week). The last interesting thing I would like to mention and which positively surprised me is the Dalton plan, which the school uses.

1297	And that there are not many of him in Brno. We have to admit with regret that most of them deal only with traditional and typical tasks of art education, which are by no means innovative, motivating or even creative for children.

136	Dramatization is also an excellent way to solve e.g. social or class problems and quarrels. The dramatization of songs in music education consists in the fact that students dramatize the lyrics of the song. We did a competition in which students had to play any song that everyone knows. Then we guessed what kind of song it was.	We did a competition in which students had to play any song that everyone knows.	Experience	[4]	K
683	When a day is useless, it can look like this. We came to the school with the accompanying teacher and my colleagues told us that 6. -9. grades write Pythagoras with class teachers. So we were supposed to have time off, but in the middle of the hour a student came to the office with a reminder if something was going on that we were not in class. We were horrified to find out the situation and it happened that only 6. -8. years wrote a competition and nines did not.

2165	Before the start of the second lesson, Michal asked me if I had said everything I needed to know about the vectorization tool last time. I said yes. I thought about it until he showed me that he could work with the tool in a different way. I felt stupid because I was trying to prepare 100% for the lesson. However, this is often the case in the programs and Michal was fully aware of it.	I thought about it until he showed me that he could work with the tool in a different way.	Reflection	[2, 5]
5681	"I thought it might be more effective than constantly reprimanding students and raising their voices.

4049	The practice is starting to gain in importance and I am changing my position from observer to teacher. I thought the preparations would be much harder.

304	I have been practicing since October 11, 2018 at the JasanovÃ¡ primary school, Brno - Jundrov. I listen to seventh and ninth grades, Czech language and civics lessons.

1385	I was teaching eighth grade, and I was unlucky that it was raining outside. This made the students worse than I expected. I thought it would be an hour, like any other, but the weather, with the mood and whim of the class, worked wonders.

756	My friend (also a teacher) had a similar opinion, but he has not yet met a student with PAS. But I think it will definitely meet us all. Although I wish it wasn't in such a large class. I am happy for the time spent in this class, it will certainly give me a lot of experience.	But I think it will definitely meet us all.	Reflection	[5, 5]
3988	The second class lesson was completely different. The students cooperated very nicely, they were disciplined, very sharp and the lesson had a completely different charge. But I think the situation in the first grade would be different if I was alone in teaching. The presence of the accompanying teacher made me slightly uncertain, and my demeanor was not entirely natural and not as authoritative as it could be.	But I think the situation in the first grade would be different if I was alone in teaching.	Reflection	[4, 6]
2575	Of course, teaching in a classroom with thirty children is challenging. Because there are always calmer children in this class, as well as wild, active, loud children, etc. But I think that even such a class should be managed by a good teacher without much difficulty and not complain every time he leaves. So far, my feelings from school are mixed. I wonder how the next lessons will go.

5599	In the future, I will definitely want to try teaching in a class of 30 students and try what it's like to work with such a large one. I think it's an even more challenging discipline. more demanding discipline. I also try to have an overview of what is happening in the whole class, but with such a large class I will have to focus even more on it.	I think it's an even more demanding discipline.	Reflection	[6, 4]
7076	My accompanying teacher gave me the opportunity to choose the class and topic I will teach. I like that she didn't ask us to teach just one lesson, but the whole topic. I think that in this way we will be better aware of how to plan lessons, schedule time, but most of all we will go through the whole teaching process and we can work with activities that follow each other. So I chose to teach the topic of totalitarian regimes in 9th grade. At first I saw everything in pink. This topic had a time allowance of 3 teaching hours.

Belief	[3, 3]
1893	However, I think we need to see the difference between the active use of our vocabulary and the mere receipt of information, which can also be enriched with various supporting materials to make the interpretation clearer and better understood. It is also important for students to learn to guess the meaning of words that they do not fully understand, and thus deal with a difficult situation.

6692	They already had the basics of physics and worked well together. In the second lesson, I taught redox reactions in ninth graders, and they didn't understand anything at all. I think it's not entirely my fault, because this topic already requires that he can name compounds and write down a chemical reaction, and they couldn't do that at all. They tried to get involved, they communicated a lot, but they showed off rather than because of the chemistry curriculum.

6934	It is wonderful that in class he may never have to calm down by increasing or changing the volume of speech, or similar tricks. Pupils' motivation for the subject is relatively high. I think better than the previous schools I visited. Certainly, this is thanks to the teacher. The director's natural history lessons, which he has only in one seventh grade, are different.	I think better than the previous schools I visited.	Reflection	[5, 5]
3596	"Even though I was a dragonfly after the first semester, I probably want to be a teacher and I will go for my lifelong dream. I think that this profession could fulfill me, even though it is really, really demanding, both time and mentally, because there is always a problem or snag either with the students or with the parents, because when I quote the teacher, then ""The worst parents are in this profession."" I'm already looking forward to the next days spent at elementary school, because at university you are still stressed and making (in English) unnecessary mistakes."

2677	There are also so-called favorites who are summoned, praised, and then some who are just rebuked.

6706	I felt good walking among the students, as I mentioned above, and standing right in front of them. I think that even for overall communication with students, it is better if you are not sitting behind the department.

I think that even for overall communication with students, it is better if you are not sitting behind the department.	Reflection	[6, 5]
487	From an educational point of view, it would probably be more appropriate to wait until he obeys and descends. Most of the students in the classroom watched the situation and quite enjoyed it. I think that even though I left the boy room for him to come down alone, I didn't hesitate and took him off the windowsill myself to end the whole situation as soon as possible.

6754	There are only sixteen students in the eighth grade, most of them girls. The whole class is very calm, but at the same time communicative and responds very well and cooperates with teachers.

6019	It is a protection against indiscipline, the disintegration of the clock, chaos. But I don't want to do it this way. I think it is possible to maintain discipline, even if we let the pupils create, express themselves on the topic, when we involve activities, games, etc. in the teaching. But on the other hand, I was in a music class in another teacher, who tried not to suffocate the students so much.	I think it is possible to maintain discipline, even if we let the pupils create, express themselves on the topic, when we involve activities, games, etc. in the teaching.	Reflection	[6, 5]
6930	Then he gets up, wrinkles his forehead, and asks who would like to go to the blackboard. Of course, no one logs in, so he summons a student according to the name list. I don't think he even knows his first name. While rehearsing, they both stand at the blackboard, face to face.	I don't think he even knows his first name.	Reflection	[3, 3]
4690	I probably managed to do that, I definitely managed to attract them. I think it's better to arouse students' interest in German than to torture them with some complex grammar that they still can't master at the A1 output level. What is the disadvantage of such teaching is the time the teacher spends preparing. I understood why most teachers teach only by completing exercises.	I think it's better to arouse students' interest in German than to torture them with some complex grammar that they still can't master at the A1 output level.	Reflection	[6, 4]
3446	All pupils will understand this, because every 2nd grade pupil already knows English in topics such as family, hobbies, etc. I think it's sometimes good to include a little English in German. In general, if a student does not know how to say German, he will say it in English.	I think it's sometimes good to include a little English in German.	Belief	[6, 3]

5147	Next week I will have the opportunity to lead a lesson, so I'm counting on this type of teaching. I think it's more effective than working with a textbook too often. I think it is important to give students enough space for self-realization and creativity. In fact, there is not much to complain about this school. Everything works as it should.	I think it's more effective than working with a textbook too often.	Reflection	[5, 6]
5851	About a minute remained until the end of the hour. The teacher asked the students how they worked and how they did. Pupils gave thumbs up / horizontally / down. I think it's a nice quick feedback clock. That's how it started. The second part of the practice. I do it at the same school as the first one, so a lot hasn't really changed for me and I know what I'm going to do.	I think it's a nice quick feedback clock.	Reflection	[4, 6]
235	In my opinion, the topic is interesting, but the students who are sitting in the last desks draw, model plasticine, throw papers at each other and still giggle at something. I think it's also because the teacher just sits in the front of the chair and doesn't walk among the students at all. Although she tries, she draws pictures on the blackboard and draws memorization aids in the telephone numbers that belong to various rescue service units.	I think it's also because the teacher just sits in the front of the chair and doesn't walk among the students at all.	Reflection	[5, 5]
2681	Thanks to the fulfillment of the number of all lessons, I arranged the interrogations at the given elementary school with two other teachers of Geography, Mr. Mgr. MitaÅ¡ and Mr. Bc. BajuÅ¾Ã­ka. I think it's great in terms of being able to follow 3 teachers and compare their content, how they manage discipline, what tests they give to students and what a table they have for evaluation. Surely this experience will give me more than if I were with only one teacher. In Russian, my accompanying teacher became Mrs. Mgr. Tailor.	I think it's great in terms of being able to follow 3 teachers and compare their content, how they manage discipline, what tests they give to students and what a table they have for evaluation.	Reflection	[6, 4]
4161	In music education, I prepared a method of dramatizing songs. In general, there is no time left for dramatization both in music education and in the Czech language. I think it's a great pity, because during dramatization they can practice almost all key competencies or connect cross-sectional topics, which strengthens the positive classroom climate and interpersonal ties. Dramatization is also an excellent way to solve e.g. social or class problems and quarrels. The dramatization of songs in music education consists in the fact that students dramatize the lyrics of the song.	I think it's a great pity, because during dramatization they can practice almost all key competencies or connect cross-sectional topics, which strengthens the positive classroom climate and interpersonal ties.	Belief	[6, 3]
3330	I must also emphasize that I liked the motivation of the pupils through the game, for which the pupils were awarded marks of lesser value. I think that every teacher should be aware that students do not have to be assessed only through written papers or oral examinations, where performance is often worse due to the nervousness of students than with spontaneous expression of knowledge. I sincerely admit that I experience considerable complications with writing self-reflection.

2514	I felt quite sorry for her at that moment. At the same time, they had someone in the group who is very smart. I think that if they were used to working in groups more often, maybe their cooperation would improve and it would look different. The question is, do you use this method in mathematics? Before I led the lesson myself, I felt nervous and nervous.	I think that if they were used to working in groups more often, maybe their cooperation would improve and it would look different.	Reflection	[5, 4]
1901	So a few minutes later, he decided to write a paper, but before that he basically went through them with almost all the answers to the questions, which I didn't like at all. I think that when it comes to a pre-announced paper and they are writing about it for the second time, it will not be a problem for the students to learn it or at least look at it at home. However, when the students received the paper, they did not hesitate to open the notebook under the desk and copy it from it. Some even picked up the phone.	I think that when it comes to a pre-announced paper and they are writing about it for the second time, it will not be a problem for the students to learn it or at least look at it at home.	Reflection	[6, 4]
1862	Activation teaching methods should be used mainly in more problematic classes. I also think about why the teacher talks about this class as problematic. I think the stumbling block is in students' approach to music education. They don't like it, they don't find the meaning of those hours, maybe they're bored, so they just interrupt. But I'm afraid the cause of all this is in the teacher's approach.	I think the stumbling block is in students' approach to music education.	Belief	[5, 5]
4335	In fact, I felt more happy than the student. But I didn't mind at all. I don't think he wanted to show his joy in front of his classmates, even though they supported him very nicely and were happy with him. And just such moments are personally important for me to remind me that not everything is always black, as it may seem at first glance.	I don't think he wanted to show his joy in front of his classmates, even though they supported him very nicely and were happy with him.	Reflection	[5, 4]
2167	One day I want to be just like her. I like her attitude towards students, but also her own learning. I think that the children seem to love her and respect her. The second hour took place at 8A. I also had this class in music today. Apparently she is quite talkative and likes to show off.	I think that the children seem to love her and respect her.	Reflection	[4, 5]
4988	So how to deal with these situations? To leave them, because it's just an education (from which someone can graduate) or to set strict rules that this is not possible in class? I think if it was a bigger paper, when they would tell me about it at the beginning of class, it is possible shorten the hour and give them some time, especially when it's a two-hour race, but that's how much it disturbed. This week I ended my several-month stay at school.	I think if it was a bigger paper, when they would tell me about it at the beginning of the lesson, I could shorten the lesson and give them some time, especially when it's a two-hour lesson, but that's how much it disturbed.	Reflection	[6, 5]
6162	I prepared worksheets for students and various tasks, for example, to describe how the lock works. I think the worksheets entertained the students. As part of the consultation with the accompanying teacher, I realized that I had to color the water in the connected containers with something so that the students in the back benches could see.	I think the worksheets entertained the students.	Reflection	[6, 4]
5103	Then she entered the situation and took the assistant aside. I think the assistant's reaction was inadequate. If someone stepped on me like that, I'm sure I'd close, I'd probably get mad and I wouldn't be working by the end of the class.	I think the assistant's reaction was inadequate.	Reflection	[6, 5]
6577	On the other hand, I was excited to have the opportunity to teach for an hour. I think that in the end I managed to tame the whole class and teach the students something new. In my opinion, the problem arises when the accompanying teacher mentions that our trainee will lead the lesson today and thus we will write the next lesson of the promised test.	I think that in the end I managed to tame the whole class and teach the students something new.	Reflection	[4, 6]
1307	The previous lesson I taught a class with 19 students. I tried to prepare thoroughly again and especially to try to involve the students as much as possible, so that it would be at least a little fun. I think I did quite well, we talked about various interesting things in the senses in different animals, we tested how sensitive one has, what is the difference in tactile sensitivity of the fingertips and back, pupillary reflex, optical illusions and more . I am glad that I managed to organize the lesson meaningfully and in time.	I think I did quite well, we talked about various interesting things in the senses in different animals, we tested how sensitive one has, what is the difference in tactile sensitivity of the fingertips and back, pupillary reflex, optical illusions and more .	Reflection	[5, 5]
6559	I tried to discuss with the students about the various possibilities of the results, if they did not know the advice, then lead them to figure it out for themselves. I think I did quite well for the first time. 2. Music lessons So far, I've only seen two lessons, with the first being in third grade.	I think I did quite well for the first time.	Reflection	[4, 6]
6013	It's about how the teacher approached it. The teacher told the students that she did not know how to help them and that she did not have time to deal with it. I think that's how trust breaks. They had to put in the effort and courage to speak for the whole class, speaking for the whole class, and she dismissed them in this way.	I think that's how trust breaks.	Reflection	[5, 5]
3389	Since these projects were created under her leadership, it was clear that she is very proud of the children and was very satisfied with the projects. I think that every teacher who works with children should have such enthusiasm. I was quite surprised that even after so many years in education, she is still excited about her work. When we returned to class, the children shared their jobs.	I think that every teacher who works with children should have such enthusiasm.	Belief	[6, 4]
6545	But again, I can't rate when I've been there a month and they've been working with him for 4 years. So I think that in some ways this practice was beneficial for me, but next time I would definitely choose another accompanying teacher. I was sitting with the children in class during the break, I heard them talking about who I was. They probably thought I was their new classmate.	So I think that in some ways this practice was beneficial for me, but next time I would definitely choose another accompanying teacher.	Reflection	[6, 5]
5022	But that was the wonderful feeling after the class. It seemed to me exactly like talking and playing after school! I think it was because the teaching was really enriched with the game. Throwing the ball to the students who answer the questions. This is something that I consider a great practice for practice and students will definitely appreciate it.	I think it was because the teaching was really enriched with the game.	Reflection	[6, 5]
6541	I learned that it doesn't get paid, that in fact all teachers go with children like this even in their free time. I think this is one more reason for the children to value it much more and perhaps then try to be less problematic. Anyway, despite that, I really enjoyed it and again I confirmed that I really want to become a teacher, even if it's not always so easy.	I think this is one more reason for the children to value it much more and perhaps then try to be less problematic.	Reflection	[6, 5]
5973	The students described the painting and then tried to guess what is typical of Surrealism. Some were more active, some less, some not at all. I don't think it's unusual. It is true that I could have deliberately called on those students who were not involved in the debate at all, but unfortunately it did not occur to me at that moment.	I don't think it's unusual.

7081	The teacher has her established order and system - write the title in this color and underline it twice, corrections are written in green pen, if it is a crayon, it is already wrong. I think that by clinging to the little things she loses the time she could use for some revitalizing activity. The classes work mainly with textbooks and workbooks.

800	"The geography and history of Great Britain were discussed in a sample group of seventh grades, and 90% of the lesson the teacher spoke Czech. After an hour, she told me that the children would not understand the interpretation in English. I think that a certain part of the lesson could be conducted in English even when discussing such a complex subject, with the help of various videos and pictures projected on the screen, which is available to each class of this school. I really liked how the teacher incorporated her personal experiences and observations into the interpretation, which would probably not have such a ""charm"" for the pupils in English."

2835	Once the whole situation happened, it was easiest to shout at them and give them the punishment they had to deliver for another hour. I don't think it was wrong when I shouted at the boy. But was it right to give them the punishment they were to bring for another hour? Moreover, when the teacher normally gives such punishments?	I don't think it was wrong when I shouted at the boy.

2292	I think that explaining the curriculum to students who do not understand something in the first example is, of course, more strenuous for each teacher, but on the other hand a great benefit, because it also develops itself.

4877	I connected the lessons with Surrealism and the work of Salvador Dali. I think the teaching went quite well. I started the beginning of the lesson with a joint discussion on a selected painting by Salvador Dali. The students described the painting and then tried to guess what is typical of Surrealism.	I think the teaching went quite well.	Reflection	[2, 2]
611	Another art class class quite upset me. The style of writing in the notebook was terrible. I was bored too. She dictated the text to the children and they wrote quickly.

1682	Specifically, I had the opportunity to teach a few hours of health education. I think that teaching health is beneficial for the pupils in the classroom where I had the opportunity to teach, because it deals with issues from everyday life that are close to them.

2492	Even those who initially refused to communicate were active and answered my questions without any problems. I think that caring for your students and building a good relationship with them is a major step towards successful learning and motivating students in general.

3803	I find it really great for students to learn to solve their problems and face them as soon as possible. I think that the marks obtained are then valued much more.

2956	It reminds me of how good I felt as a student in elementary school. I will learn or experience something new at every other internship. So I think in time I'll get even more armored and I won't deal with the little things like now. I constantly think about things that an experienced educator probably won't even think of, do I? Maybe in a while I will be able to answer this question myself.	So I think in time I'll get even more armored and I won't deal with the little things like now.	Reflection	[5, 5]
5257	I was also a little against fur, when I was given the task to test the next lesson to see if they memorized these terms (or they had them written in a notebook and textbook). I think it would be more appropriate for this topic to take a practical example where they encounter some controversial legislation. For example, in the news, the boys had a court decision concerning the activities of UBER.	I think it would be more appropriate for this topic to take a practical example where they encounter some controversial legislation.	Reflection	[5, 5]
4807	"I have five classes together and so far I have difficulty remembering one. Fortunately, they have the labels, but I try to use them less and less so that I don't rely too much on them. I think that when I remember them all, the learning will be a bit more pleasant, because I will not feel and I will not have such an ""alien"" impression.

436	As part of the consultation with the accompanying teacher, I realized that I had to color the water in the connected containers with something so that the students in the back benches could see. What would I do differently? I think it would be nice for everyone to try to work out a worksheet first and then check in pairs. I noticed that some didn't really work and only copied from a friend.

834	At the same time, they would apologize to me and the whole class for using such inappropriate words that we had to listen to.

189	"After an hour of listening to history at nine, I had three hours off, so I was looking for a bit of seizure. I offered to fix the papers.

4228	We'll see if he really agrees. Feelings: Pupils: Pupils felt understanding, everyone agreed. The conflict was not emotional, so probably calm.

4469	I would definitely focus more on that next time. In fact, I was already careful in the next few hours. The worst was in the 7th A, where the class was making a mess.

5224	For example, the afternoon hours can no longer be concentrated at all. On Friday, he has been unfocused since morning. I think it's really too much for him. In mathematics, they now gained the contents and volumes of bodies.	I think it's really too much for him.	Reflection	[6, 4]
3894	The one who constantly interrupts is ignorant and does not do her best. How is it possible that it looks like this on the outside and there is something else hidden inside?

6399	Overall, I feel very good about the ongoing practice. I felt good at school, in the cabinet with the teachers as well. I quite enjoyed the lessons.

I was very warmly welcomed and the whole practice was smooth.	I think I chose the right field for a master's degree.	Reflection	[3, 3]
4004	I transferred one student, who was constantly making a mess, to the front desk. I think I handled the situation well, but it didn't help as much as I could have imagined.

6046	I am personally satisfied. I will try to gradually eliminate the ailments that I have discovered (quite a few) until the next time. However, one learns through mistakes.

5395	When I came to school, I didn't have to be too nervous yet. I was waiting for Viking lessons. Well, that's a topic, that's something for me. I think I quite attracted the students.

3899	Throughout our two-hour class, my colleague and I had to improvise several times. I think we managed and we finished the hour.

1171	"That feeling of satisfaction is simply divine. From the very beginning, I put on a friendly relationship. Pupils wrote their names on cards so that I could address them directly.

875	If not, they will make Christmas school decorations. In this reflection, I would like to think a little more about the teaching profession and the general purpose of the internship in the follow-up master's degree. I think that as students and future educators, we realize that being a practice-independent observer and a person from the outside who teaches a maximum of a few hours is something completely different from being in school every day, building stronger relationships with students, solving their daily worries and their problems, and still have full responsibility for their education. Maybe that's also the reason why a lot of intern students realize that they never really want to learn in their lives and unfortunately leave this profession.

4568	I have to say that my motivation has improved again since the last newspaper and I did better overall.

2076	The children and the teacher thoroughly examined both the shape of the emblem and the lions and eagles. In order for the children to notice the lion's attitude, they all stood up and imitated him humorously with the teacher.

5580	Therefore, I conclude that the purpose of my practice has been fulfilled, although it would be better to spend more time here. I think that I will return to this school or continue to work on the creation of mentally handicapped children. I enjoy the practice a lot.

48	I don't think I was able to interconnect the activities so that the students understood that they had a common meaning, and overall I think I was wrong to explain the curriculum, I'm not sure if they took anything from that lesson.

4093	Last hour, the teacher instructed the children to draw comics. She handed them some examples of other cartoon and painted comics, as well as a short fairy tale for which they came up with a specific comic.

3024	"The teacher immediately realized how the mistake had arisen, so she didn't have to react to it in a purely negative way, but in the style of ""it would be if there was a plus"". I think such a reaction is desirable because the student knows that even though he did not do something well, he showed some knowledge. Later we will also practice examples of ""opposite"" (we modify the multiplied expression to the form ""brackets"")."	I think such a reaction is desirable because the student knows that even though he did not do something well, he showed some knowledge.	Reflection	[4, 5]
3496	I think that such activities, which, for example, include a data projector, are activating for the pupils, because they take turns and go gradually to add the right answers, which certainly benefits them.

3947	Practice is running and running, we are already halfway there. I have already taught in tandem. I think tandem is a great thing to start with. Really good for a start.

2601	In the next lesson, where Africa was taught, a presentation with pictures was launched. The children then wrote down the key words on the board and it was again written down. I think this method is good and I personally like it very much, when the children are involved in the class and they don't just sit on the benches and don't listen to or write from the board. The first internship in geography was special for me, as we did not have a classic lesson in class, but we prepared field lessons with GPS for students.

5294	I definitely took something from it and I will try to work on it. I think it's going to be slow, it's nice that this one tells me everything, I'll take it to heart, but then I still focus on so many things that I can't improve everything. Immediately a week later, I had Associate Professor KratochvÃ­lovÃ¡, the head of the department, at the lesson.

3512	And if not by chance, I caught a name in my memory and addressed the student. I mainly tried to address students I knew they didn't pay much attention to. I think it worked quite well. Only at the end of the hour did their attention wane. Having more experience, I would try to reactivate the students somehow, but at the moment I couldn't think of anything.

5520	I think that learning in one piece, even if only for one week, would be much more beneficial for both the trainee and the children. The thing I was quite struggling with was writing papers.

145	I think that much more time should be devoted to art education so that students can fully express their creativity and not always just try to win the battle against time.

4434	In my second specialization - civic education - I focus on e.g. in order to learn to evaluate students adequately, At the beginning of the lesson they always have news ready, My task is to give them some feedback and a mark. and a stamp. So I try to be fair in the evaluation, to estimate who participated in the preparation to what extent and what was their presentation, how much they tried, etc.	My job is to give them some feedback and a mark.

6994	I thought about it internally and compared this approach with the music education I experienced myself in high school.

3789	She briefly informed me in advance about the classes I went to talk to. Overall, she was very accommodating and dedicated to me. However, I was most interested in the art classroom. Unlike the other elementary schools I went to see, this classroom was perfectly equipped. Everywhere I looked, there were piles of different materials.	However, I was most interested in the art classroom.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6633	On the contrary, my teacher at NJ in high school used tactics to criticize everyone and annoy them a little, so that they would deny themselves and prove to him that they had it. I was uncomfortable, I'm the one who needs praise, it's motivating for me and I think that's how most people have it. It often happened to the teacher from the gym that someone cried under his criticism. In my opinion, this only aroused resistance to the subject among the criticized.	I was uncomfortable, I'm the one who needs praise, it's motivating for me and I think that's how most people have it.	Feeling	[5, 5]
4615	I don't mind, I'm glad I can relieve them a little and they leave me a free hand in teaching. In computer science, the lessons are much calmer and more comfortable. I always have only half the class, so there is more peace in class. Teaching a citizen is more challenging for me.	I don't mind, I'm glad I can relieve them a little and they leave me a free hand in teaching.	Feeling	[5, 3]
2570	I started to be much more involved in teaching. The teacher from RJ also uses me in her other subjects such as; OV or ÄJ. I find it great, because I also got an overview of how it actually works in other subjects. The students are great, I have not experienced any major indiscipline yet.	I find it great, because I also got an overview of how it actually works in other subjects.	Feeling	[3, 4]
4599	What the teacher didn't tell me after the first lesson, but my classmate, who was also in the lesson, was that I can't approach the children at school individually. It made me very upset at that moment and I was sad about it. How can I teach children if I don't know them?	It made me very upset at that moment and I was sad about it.	Feeling	[7, 6]
4596	At the beginning, there was a presence and entry in the class book, so nothing unusual. However, I was fascinated by the way in which the teacher performed this routine activity. Everything seemed so interesting and especially funny.	However, I was fascinated by the way in which the teacher performed this routine activity.	Feeling	[4, 4]

1196	In a class in which I taught German to ninth-graders, I decided to speak German to them for an entire class. I was to practice listening with them for an hour and then a conversation between two guests and a waiter in a restaurant ordering food and drinks.

2977	"Then we will hang out in a circle. I would like to briefly evaluate my last ""performance"" in elementary school and attend a history class I took last week. I was to enter over the threshold of the seventh grade class, where I already taught German, this time history.

I was to enter over the threshold of the seventh grade class, where I already taught German, this time history.	Experience	[4, 2]
2229	It seemed to me that I didn't score as much as I had hoped for the sevens. I had high expectations, but some students found me very bored. I guess I'll have to get used to it. Because I have a cold, my voice is not as intense as usual. Well, it's always important to find an excuse.	I had high expectations, but some students found me very bored.	Reflection	[5, 2]
1241	But students are already used to this, and if I wanted to do it differently, they would have to be used to it from the beginning, what would start working with me. I had an excellent response from students and teachers. When I said goodbye to the students, they said that it was a pity that it was a lot of fun and that I should come again.	I had an excellent response from students and teachers.	Perspective	[4, 1]
1988	I was originally supposed to teach seventh, eighth and ninth grades. The English language at this school is divided into three levels, from the weakest to the strongest. I was lucky to find a good situation where the level of sevens and eights is exactly the same, so one preparation for two hours is enough and it is interesting to watch how the students fight with it. The very first week I taught, I had a hard time. And specifically with nines. It was a Thursday when I normally teach three hours in a row, geography-English-geography.

3852	I know that, for example, teachers even say to themselves when the atmosphere in the classroom is not exactly inclined to the atmosphere, so I was thinking about how to deal with such pre-announced information. Should I relieve my claims and make it lighter before such an hour, or should I go to class and hope to get her under control and do something?	Should I discount the claims before such an hour and make it lighter?	Reflection	[6, 5]
6058	To make matters worse, I learned two more German lessons, so in total I taught them six out of German instead of four. I should learn to say no clearer and more vigorous, a knowledge for the next time. Sixth grade super as always. There is still effort and enthusiasm. What about eight?	I should learn to say no clearer and more vigorous, a knowledge for the next time.	Learning	[3, 3]
2731	I know it's definitely an advantage, because after an hour you get feedback and you know what you did well and what you did wrong. But I was still a little scared, I was afraid that I would disappoint my accompanying teacher and that he wouldn't happen to say that I was completely impossible. In the end it was quite nice! Preparing for two hours took me quite a while.	But I was still a little scared, I was afraid that I would disappoint my accompanying teacher and that he wouldn't happen to say that I was completely impossible.	Feeling	[5, 7]
5319	I can't imagine learning even more. I was very tired and the noise at school really bothered me a lot after four o'clock. I wanted to go for a walk in the woods or in the fields, just somewhere outside the noisy Brno. Nevertheless, these taught lessons charged me with more positive impressions, new motivation and a desire to improve my learning.

1276	I cut twenty-two different memory games, dominatrixes, prepared worksheets and described when and how I would perform each exercise in class with students. I had a good feeling how the two hours would be worked out and how I would enjoy it in peace, because I would know what awaited me. No trembling knees or constant questions in the head type: What now? Is this good? Is there der or das? Jemine, we can't catch up! Just five minutes ?!

5948	They didn't ignore me anymore, they even started greeting me at the rat. I even felt that as they walked past me, they seemed to calm down and get out of my way.

3292	I had activities ready for him and I was wondering if it would work. Before that, however, I was given a task that paralyzed me for a few seconds. I was supposed to supervise the girls from 9th C. They were creating materials for the project day.

6131	We were just repeating prisms (cube and block). I also realized that it is better to have the preparation prepared on one sheet of paper. I had it on 3 papers and then, when you put the paper away somewhere, in the meantime it explains something, it loses an overview of which paper follows and where it lies at all. This does not occur to a person at home until he really tries it - even so, a trivial thing can decide a person at that moment.

1482	But instead of the children being happy and trying to behave better for another hour, everything was almost the same. So I should have given them fives, and I had encountered indiscipline even in first grade. When the children couldn't stand their attention, I thought it was probably because they weren't used to it.	So I should have given them fives?	Reflection	[7, 3]
6901	At the same time, it is one of the important things in language - to be able not only to say words, but also to write correctly according to me. I also had the opportunity to correct my homework - a copy of 8 incomplete sentences, where it was necessary to add one word from the text. I wasn't surprised at what some wrote there.

2415	I'll see what next week brings. In this diary, I would like to contain some facts that I noticed during my own teaching. I had the opportunity to try working with all grades II. degrees. At the beginning of each of my first lessons in the class, I asked students to think: do they think that children sing little today?	I had the opportunity to try working with all grades II.	Experience	[4, 6]
4404	Now open your textbook, page 75. â-â But I don't understand you! â), Open a textbook, do exercises or engage in teaching in any other way - a complete rebellion.

5053	There came a time when my auditions turned into teaching under my own direction. I was worried because I may be too great a perfectionist and I like to think and prepare in a minute.

5942	The second part of my internship takes place at the grammar school. I had high expectations of it. Pupils are disciplined, motivated to learn and respect the teacher. I expected the problem when preparing more challenging tasks for gifted students. I was horrified by the first hour of listening.	I had high expectations of it.	Reflection	[4, 4]
6954	That gets better now. It is important to be able to look at things from different angles. . . From the very first lesson in practice, I had quite conflicting feelings. I felt that there was a big mess in the class and the students were not interested in the class. I noticed a few mistakes that the teacher made. We just talked about it the day before in didactics, so it was probably in my eyes.	I felt that there was a big mess in the class and the students were not interested in the class.	Feeling	[6, 6]
3130	"Another thing that stopped me and made me think was the word ""read"" that the boy used. I felt that the sentence had the subtext that not only did my mother not like when the boy was angry, but she also didn't like (and probably was angry with him) when the teacher wrote to her that the boy was angry in class - I had the feeling that the mother is trying to teach the boy that he should not be angry at school. This pleased me, because parents don't always have such an approach these days."

4648	When it started to rain, the sun was shining or hail was falling, someone pointed it out, and I had to do something to get the class back to class with thoughts from the window. I felt that I could not do it, and that I had no chance of finishing an hour without having to negotiate peace in class for at least half a minute. Eventually the class ended and I was a little relieved that I had it over with, and that, at least I hope, I had maintained some dignity and did not look derailed during class.

2635	Thus, the teacher cannot reach and control some students during independent work. The class is thus divided into two halves. I had the feeling that the teacher was working halfway closer to the department, the pupils in the second half of the class were unruly and inattentive, one boy even had headphones in his ears and listened to music. As the teacher focused her attention and this second half of the class, the students in the closer to the window began to make noise again.

2470	Unfortunately, I cannot carry out any of the activities that I was able to successfully use in the last semester in classes with a maximum of 17 pupils in a group of 30.

6108	The teacher would certainly have shouted at him that he was not paying attention. I was just supposed to watch, but I couldn't, and I went to look at him and see where the problem was. Otto suddenly sharpened when you noticed that I was beside him. I asked where the problem was and he replied that he didn't know what to do (oh, the instructions again).

7022	Many times in the class I was forced to raise my voice, but never as much as then. Was it too much? Should I have handled the situation differently? Probably yes. But I tried a lot of other techniques, including silence or raising my hand and waiting for silence. But nothing worked. So is it okay to yell at children?	Should I have handled the situation differently?	Reflection	[5, 6]
5173	Overall, I am satisfied with the course of both lessons and I got very positive feelings from them. I was afraid that the experience with ninth graders might demotivate me to teach older students to do so. Fortunately, she motivated me and I'm even more looking forward to having my own class.

5782	There was a kind of communication noise between me and the accompanying teacher. However, I also had my own exercises set aside, and I think that language teaching is very lenient in these situations.

5034	And they even seemed to enjoy it! On Friday I was teaching Russian in the ninth grade.

317	Unfortunately, almost two weeks of illness entered my practice - sore throat. I was thus excluded from the teaching cycle for quite some time. I was quite scared if I could get back on the train, so to speak, but after my return everything was fine. I returned to one or two hours of listening to find out how far they had progressed with the curriculum, and then I began to teach normally again.

5523	Pupils had the opportunity to express themselves, I gave the final grade based on my opinion and the discussion. Then we focused on PL on the topic of alcohol prevention. We had a presentation and a group activity ready, which we did not manage to do, because the students had a shortened lesson by 5 minutes and were going on an excursion. I hope to be able to learn the rest of the material next week. We had further education in the 7th C, also civic education.

3411	He always devotes an hour to the subject and works hard. And the result came very soon. The other students in the class also had a great test. We were glad that we taught them the subject well, and they understood it from me.

2131	But then working with such texts is completely useless. We cannot omit texts on this topic. They would not fully understand all the following literature. Perhaps we should focus more on the foundations of Christian doctrine, showing today's children that the subject is not just history, that it is still alive, and that all writers, even modern ones, refer to biblical motifs. Another text was the Epic of Gilgamesh. The text expressed great grief over the loss of a friend, hopelessness over the transience of life. Perhaps they were even more lost in this text.

1078	The hardest thing for me was probably to choose what to tell the students and, conversely, to decide what is too much. To the clock itself. My own feeling was that I managed it quite well.

3498	God knows what it was, but I'm glad to see how the whole hour went anyway. So I can say with a calm heart that I am incredibly lucky in my practice for great classes or great students.

5734	The unexpected marking didn't work out either, Jakub always has everything right, Oliver doesn't care about the marks at all. So homework. Oliver doesn't fill them again, so do the others here and there. It can happen that sometimes it really doesn't go well and it's bad to try badly, what if children don't respect borders and aren't interested in it? How strict and fair to be?

4857	She couldn't understand at all that I didn't want to give her a bad grade or penalty points, that I just wanted to understand why she refused to cooperate. Is the overall setting and philosophy of the school to blame for this approach? In the end, I concluded that I would talk to the teacher about how we would solve it.

5080	The teacher told me that Honza had autism, which explained a lot. But what I didn't expect would be overwhelmed by regret. . . . Yes, did the teacher feel sorry for her student?

2096	The main difference is in the number of students. I had full classes in Brno, which means some 30 children. At the elementary school in Valtice, I have a maximum of 20 pupils in my class, mostly around 16. Pupils are used to working, they are communicative, so when I ask questions, I always get some answers - calmly and wrong, I'm especially glad that students communicate with me.

802	But the eighth grade is hell. Pupils have fun, they do it on purpose, they cry, they don't pay attention. Terrible. I wouldn't be nervous about the whole class and I would give an ultimatum that either everyone would listen immediately or get a five. I don't know if this is the right pedagogical procedure, I would definitely find out during the internship, but at that moment I would probably act like this, impulsively and without debate.

5769	The first one I taught was mainly about phonetics and pronunciation and I didn't work with the textbook at all. It took me about 3 hours to prepare for it.

3479	In a Czech lesson, the teacher asks all the children. He wants them to figure it out for themselves. I liked that it was not a plain interpretation and the children just didn't listen to the teacher. On the other hand, the lesson was busy and the teacher was constantly admonishing someone.

On the one hand, it is positive, as it leads future teachers to adopt functional patterns (that is, if the accompanying teacher uses an approach that works and is successful, which also seems to me not always true from the experience of colleagues) .

There is no time for a laboratory exercise, which takes the whole lesson, and more or less not for some more fun exercises, because the teacher has to discuss the subject to the same extent as before, but in half the shorter time.

In my previous internship, it happened to me that a few students, despite repeating their assignments several times and they all told me that they understood what I wanted from them, drew a sheet in the middle of the paper. This time I wanted to avoid this problem, so I explained everything to the students really carefully.

We've been discussing movement together for some time. I am very proud of the preparations on this topic, as I have often managed to alternate between different activities.

4361	My accompanying teacher warned me before the students entered the chemistry classroom. As soon as the class began, the class teacher and the deputy principal ran into the classroom. They both shouted at the students because they didn't lock their class in chemistry and left a big mess in the class. There was crazy chaos in the classroom. While the deputy was trying to arrange the cleaning of the class with someone, the class teacher was still screaming.

I would like to focus on that in the next weeks of my teaching.	Intention	[5, 4]
3412	After class, I had a discussion with both the teacher and the teacher. They made me some criticisms or recommendations until next time, for which I was very happy.

153	Again, I didn't estimate the time, and gave them a little less time to write than they would need. I stretched the hour by two minutes. I have to be careful about that again next time and set aside more time to write. After the lesson, the accompanying teacher also told me that I should dictate the record and keep it for 15 minutes.

Subsequently, the students counted independently and the teacher settled the absence in the meantime and wrote it down. In this way, I like that the teacher does not waste time and will handle this administration only when the students work independently.

7071	In Health Education, I had a choice between two teachers, and in the end I chose a younger teacher, a few years after college. We are currently two interns at this elementary school, and according to information from the faculty, we were to come to the principal's office on the first day of internship at 7:45 for a meeting with the school principal and accompanying teachers.

5902	But it was an experience. This atypical hour gave me a lot, more such hours. Today I taught chemistry for the first time. I don't have completely pleasant feelings about it. I had a lot of printed activities for the students ready for teaching, I had other assignments on the board, plus a prepared demonstration of another experiment for the whole class. Anyway, I had different expectations in my head. I think I underestimated the theoretical preparation a bit, the topic of the clock was molecules, which seemed relatively simple, but the reality was different.

At the beginning of the lesson, I promised that the one who would have the most correct answers from the questions in the video would praise him. At the end of the class, however, I had a problem with time, and in my distraction I forgot the praise. I did not praise anyone at all, and I consider that a big mistake.

4609	Since the first part of the practice I spent more listening, a few notes and inspirations. At the beginning of each lesson, PU asks students about the activities / projects that took place in the period before its teaching, thanks to which it not only obtains information about the current mood in the classroom, but also teaches its students to express themselves. (The way he asks the question.) I consider reading workshops to be a great positive in teaching Czech at Husovka.

1345	In this diary, I would like to contain some facts that I noticed during my own teaching. I had the opportunity to try working with all grades II. degrees. At the beginning of each of my first lessons in a given class, I asked students to think: Do they think that children sing little today, and why is that? At the beginning, I had to make the students think a little, but when the discussion started, at least half of the class always got involved.

305	Multiplication, division of polynomials, and compound expressions were discussed. So I can evaluate all three classes. I admire the teacher for being able to remember what she discussed with the class. At the beginning of the year, when math is every day, he teaches the same subject for three hours. During the year, however, there are various trips, excursions, theaters, etc. The teaching is decided in such a way that, for example, one class is three days behind.

1543	I really liked the games and activities that the teachers had for the pupils, ready to unite the team. It was seen that in the course they improved in collective activity. In the beginning, they did not behave like one team. I really liked the overall program, it was just very demanding for the students, it was clear that they are already very tired.

In conclusion, I could say that I'm still not sure if I want to teach. So far, it looks like no, but I'll give it a chance and see it later in the practice.

2965	But I came and ruined everything. In addition, I had the task to write a short test with them at the beginning of the class. And everything was wrong.

2692	The number of hours I have to teach has already been met. However, as long as I have the opportunity, I will want to teach rather than listen. It's a better practice for me.

4605	Otherwise, the others completely missed the topic, they obviously did not understand what we were talking about. It made me wonder if there was something wrong with our system. Our European culture is based on Christianity, but most of today's children miss it completely, it is terribly distant for them, perhaps even outdated, unnecessary.

1447	That's the way it is in that artist, it's busy, the teacher has to guide the students all the time and there is probably no choice but to get used to it.

7089	But I'm curious when the teacher comes next week, how they will treat her. I understand that they take substitution more as a free lesson, so I won't jump to conclusions yet. I won't lie, I'm a little scared, because in 2 minutes you only have 2 short exercises from the workbook. I believe that it will be better with the teacher and that she will definitely be able to involve and motivate them more than some exercise in a workbook.

5936	As I have already mentioned, the investigation of bullying was underway and the teacher, as an educational counselor, had to be there. What about now? There was no one to desecrate it, so I got an offer to go learn it. There were a few things in my head right away: no preparation? Don't I know the students at all?

7056	First, I had to agree with my accompanying teacher on what topic of the lesson would be appropriate and also what activity to choose for the class.

3488	I was shocked because I was expecting the exact opposite. Although it was not absolute silence, I did not even expect it from them, because I had never experienced them in silence.

5896	I also had dances or a body play for the songs, but I didn't have time for that. I was happy with what we did. It was not enough. One more finding. When I had the other classes from Hv, they kept their chairs away from the piano.	It was not enough.	Other	[6]
505	Not only did we laugh quite a bit at the interpretation of how an upright man ran into a cave with a burning stick and turned it off several times during the journey.

581	I admire the teacher for staying completely calm in this unpleasant situation full of negative emotions and screaming. She was not afraid to enter into an argument and explained to both sides what they wanted to say if they didn't just shout at each other. This beginning of the lesson was very challenging. I'm surprised that after this performance, the class teacher managed to get the pupils' attention back and start a normal chemistry class.

2171	I would also consider choosing more modern songs (the argument that the teacher has been singing it for almost forty years, I really don't find convincing why they should sing it). I would let them choose to bring notes, lyrics to songs that she likes, so that we can use them to intersperse the set of obligatory folk songs that they should know.

1112	Engaging, activating and exciting our students for the cause is a very difficult task. Before the start of the game, we introduced the students to the questions and introduced them to the prizes. These were not marks, but prizes in kind.

7041	Nevertheless, perhaps the most difficult thing in practice so far for me was dealing with discipline. But some children are incredibly unruly. Not only do they not pay attention and have fun, but even some experts even run around the class and when they are reprimanded, they do not seem to realize that they are doing anything wrong. First, I tried classical methods such as admonishing, evoking, shouting, looking at them significantly or stepping on them and continuing the interpretation.

6148	The fact that I still haven't started my practice in English leads me to another idea - teachers are very busy and it's really not an easy profession.

5302	It was something new for the children, I have the impression that this is the only way I got attention. I tried to work with what I am. I saw my biggest problem in expressing and formulating sentences correctly, I definitely have to work on it. I have to work. I do not evaluate the lesson completely positively, in retrospect I blame myself for not participating in more exercises in which all children would participate.

6752	So far, the first three weeks have passed and I've somehow gradually got used to it again. The biggest problem for me is the onslaught of new people and remembering all those names.

2108	We got to their hobbies about what they were good at and I saw that they were excited that they could really communicate. I was most happy with the final feedback. My accompanying teacher praised me that I was like a fish in water among the children, that it was great, that I was not afraid of them and that the children really took me.	I was most happy with the final feedback.	Feeling	[7, 5]
6037	The biggest weakness for me is the Czech grammar. Due to the not yet very extensive and practically taught didactics at the faculty, I am quite interested in how to teach grammar (and style).	The biggest weakness for me is the Czech grammar.	Difficulty	[5, 4]

4432	Thanks to frequent calming, explanations (most children have a problem with repetitive curriculum from the second grade) and repetition, the class in the curriculum is a bit behind. The biggest problem is the student to whom I am written as an assistant teacher. Last school year I was with him as an assistant, but in a different class. I didn't think it could get worse like that.	The biggest problem is the student to whom I am written as an assistant teacher.	Difficulty	[6, 5]
2395	Whether in the field of personnel, management, SEP, classification, electronic system, etc. I have room to ask anything, as well as with my accompanying teacher Peter. So far, the most strange feeling in practice has been brought to me by the encounter with the reality of placing teachers in the school building as such. None of them have their own cabinet, as we are used to with newer buildings, but sit together in one large assembly hall.

6488	You can't catch what he can do so quickly, but it might be difficult in three or four weeks. I did not make claims completely outside of their language competence, yet they turned to me incomprehensibly when filling out the exercises as to certain words such as pillow or bed. I felt a slight remorse on their part for what I wanted in horror. Furthermore, I was easily taken aback by the following situation.	I did not make claims completely outside of their language competence, yet they turned to me incomprehensibly when filling out the exercises as to certain words such as pillow or bed.	Experience	[6, 4]
6863	I like the teacher's intonation of the voice. When he notices the increased noise in the classroom, he lowers his voice and the students calm themselves to hear it. The whole lesson is conducted in frontal form. However, it cannot be said that pupils are not given the space to express themselves. The teacher tries to make the students think about whether metaphors appear in the given literary texts, etc. After half an hour, I notice that the attention of a student with ADHD is already declining.	However, it cannot be said that pupils are not given the space to express themselves.	Other	[5, 6]
3147	On the other hand, I was acquainted with the opposite findings. In my opinion, the teacher is unnecessarily exhausting her voice, which I do not consider to be good at all for her future teaching career. I didn't like it when someone interrupted or did other activities on the desk than they were given, the teacher rather overlooked it. She no longer had the strength to admonish the student. But there was a situation where a girl really drove her crazy and she sent her out the door.

6012	Really stupid, it's awkward for eighth grade. But this is bullying. Although a weaker form, but still. I don't like that no one stood up for him. Only one boy kept saying that they were embarrassed that if they wanted to do a pank, they should take his whole bag.	I don't like that no one stood up for him.	Feeling	[4, 5]
6215	So it is extremely interesting for me to have students in front of me who are handy mostly manually and do not fit so much information into their heads during the night. They don't have such a good memory and don't see any point in it. It is therefore necessary to connect the information much better and pass the information on to them in another way. Try to capture as many senses as possible.	They don't have such a good memory and don't see any point in it.	Other	[6, 6]
4485	Unfortunately. Their class teacher teaches them in a slightly different way than is taught in a normal school. They have no rules, children are guided by their authority, which means that in class it looks as if they have a break of 8 hours a day. They crawl on the ground, sit on a bench, play hide-and-seek, fights, this is the order of the day, my accompanying teacher told me.

4268	There was still one question in my head. How can she still be so positive, smiling, energetic and at the same time have set her precise boundaries that maintain her respect and popularity? I couldn't help but notice that she won't forgive the students, everyone has to master every subject perfectly. During the lesson, everyone drilled the timing of the verb through complementary exercises, throwing a ball, and dictating various people and verbs.

2767	But what didn't happen. . . I don't know why, but today they were completely insane again.

105	On the one hand, they got it served without the possibility of actually changing anything, individualizing the sentence for themselves, but it also occurred to me that they liked the way. They didn't have to prepare extra, they took it home and maybe they looked at it. But they had support. From a natural conversation, it is difficult to print in advance what the students will take home. But they can take notes themselves.

846	Sevens, it was great there. I really like the class, you know it even when I'm preparing teaching materials. I don't have to wonder if they don't find it very childish, stupid, anything like eights. I enjoy inventing activities and it's probably the only hour I've always really been looking forward to. However, during the whole practice, I have one idea in my head.	I don't have to wonder if they don't find it very childish, stupid, anything like eights.	Other	[4, 4]
2896	I sit and wonder if I, as a seventh grade student, made gender differences between teachers. She didn't. I don't think so. I keep thinking and realize that the teacher is very kind, too much. At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher starts rehearsing.	I don't think so.	Reflection	[2, 3]
303	But lately, it seems to me that the students are a little calmer here. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm used to it. In math class it is another oasis. I don't think the difference is explicitly given by the teacher. I think that the difference is mainly given by the subject.	I don't think the difference is explicitly given by the teacher.	Reflection	[3, 6]
2985	It seemed to me as if the teacher wanted to tell me that the girls were to blame.

5293	I was very shy, but I tried and they really stopped talking and listened to me. It was a strange feeling. I don't like to be the center of attention, but when you have to teach, there is nothing left. I have to overcome that timidity and get used to it. Even if I don't teach at all, I think it's a good training for life.	I don't like to be the center of attention, but when you have to teach, there is nothing left.	Feeling	[4, 5]
3323	But the problem was that I was completely clueless. What should I do? He doesn't care about the note, he doesn't care about the five, he doesn't care about his parents.

I have absolutely nothing for him.	Difficulty	[5, 3]
6043	An hour is more enjoyable when you don't have to just sit and write. So far, I evaluate everything really positively. I have no problem with anything and I hope that it will probably remain so for the rest of the practice. I complete my internship in my hometown in the foothills of the White Carpathians in Bojkovice.	I have no problem with anything and I hope that it will probably remain so for the rest of the practice.	Feeling	[3, 2]
5450	But it was an experience. This atypical hour gave me a lot, more such hours. Today I taught chemistry for the first time. I don't have completely pleasant feelings about it. I had a lot of printed activities for the students ready for teaching, I had other assignments on the board, plus a prepared demonstration of another experiment for the whole class.	I don't have completely pleasant feelings about it.	Feeling	[6, 6]
3622	I don't have so many situations behind me that I can process this diary well.

3532	I'm glad for that. I enjoy learning and I like to invent activities for students in class, but it takes a lot of time. I don't have time to do homework for school.

6723	Lessons from crisis development: but some children read really slowly. What still struck me in the workshops is how little children are able to deduce the meaning of a word from context. Not having a second-degree diploma based on this concept would surprise me less, but when I empirically verified that the meaning from the context is largely deductible, it should work the same way for children. And it's not that they're small. The eights were pretty similar.

108	This semester I am at a village school in my place of residence. I really wanted to go to my first internship there, because I know a few teachers there, and even some students. So I was not afraid to stand in front of these students and explain the curriculum to them. But I dread the difference between a village school and a town school. Is my fear justified? Are the children in the village different from the big city?	So I was not afraid to stand in front of these students and explain the curriculum to them.	Feeling	[7, 7]
6866	I thought ninth graders would look older and older, but in reality they're still kids, at least the classes I'm listening to. I had no expectations. I wondered what awaited me.

73	They disturbed, they did not concentrate, they did not listen to the teacher at all. She eventually gave them a separate task and tried to keep them calm, at least in some way.

4567	Finally a change has come. Nine. Much more sensible and even working. But again, there are some who are not interested in doing anything about it. I wonder how to approach these children then, I can't take care of everyone individually. It is unacceptable to me that the teacher has no time for anything between lessons. After all, he didn't even get drunk all the time and didn't go to the toilet.	I can't deal with everyone individually.	Belief	[6, 3]
6468	For example, she praised my worksheet. But I would also take the negative feedback if it was reasonable. I can't shake the bad feeling of being an art teacher. Her lesson is based on an idea from her online resource called Pinterest. Children copy this idea. Such a collective copier.	I can't shake the bad feeling of being an art teacher.	Feeling	[5, 6]
4438	Well, let me tell you, I looked at them and I was quite curious about what was coming. I can't say that I was looking forward to it or that I was afraid of what awaited me.

544	But probably something. It annoys me. Enough. I'm starting to be afraid to go to class where I know I'll have the student because I'm afraid of what he'll do again.

3235		Won't he let them think about it?	Reflection	[5, 3]
2287	I am aware that the class I mention is very numerous. There are about twenty-five students, which is not enough. So it is not in the teacher's power to pay as much attention to the work as they certainly deserve.

So it is not in the teacher's power to pay as much attention to the work as they certainly deserve.	Other	[5, 6]
3581	So they haven't learned anything at all over the years, so it's been a really difficult task for me to demand something from them to accomplish after all these years. It is not the fault of those students, but the fault of the teacher. I can say I was pretty upset.	It is not the fault of those students, but the fault of the teacher.	Belief	[4, 6]
2476	At the same time, I would like to mention that it is amazing at the school where I go to practice that the school has great equipment. It's not just that students carry boxes in which they should have art supplies, but they don't, because they either lose it or don't bring them to class at all. It follows that when I came up with the topic, no one was limited, including me.

540	I managed the Czech language practice relatively quickly. I had the opportunity to try teaching in the sixth, seventh and ninth grades. Unfortunately, I leave the practice disappointed. It's not because I don't feel good at school. It's not even because I have any problems with the students or the accompanying teacher. It's not even because I'm thinking of another profession.

4606	I understand to write at the beginning when taking polynomials. But with division of polynomials, it seems unnecessary to me when division is actually multiplication by the inverse of value.

365	Pupils were introduced to the content of the next lesson last time and now many of them report to answer the question asked. It is not difficult and I evaluate this element very positively.

2238	"Then I said to myself again, ""Yeah, that surprised me, that's nice of her. ""It simply came to my notice then."	Isn't that a little rude? âI didn't dare tell the teachers to comment on their appearance, even if it was well thought out.	Reflection	[6, 4]
4841	I stood in front of the class and felt good, but embarrassed. Right after the greeting, I came up with an idea that I keep coming back to. Isn't it weird for the students that I'm only a few years old from them? I'm interpreting the curriculum and in the meantime I think I don't realize that someone so young has ever taught me. Do students perceive it?	Isn't it weird for students that I'm only a few years old?	Reflection	[6, 5]

2543	But when I teach, I have freedom there. I can do whatever I want. My hands are free. I can try what teaching style I consider suitable.

4459	They tell me that they didn't know what to do for the exercise. Are they lying to me or was there really such a noise in class that they didn't hear it?

2175	Although the students he was currently teaching had no effect on his negative mood, it was still reflected in his behavior towards them. I do not assume that he was conscious of such actions, however, he treated the pupils sarcastically and administered the substance even more without any enthusiasm. The atmosphere of the class was marked by this. Next week I have to teach in both subjects, so we are curious about the reactions of students and the development of the remaining events.

4443	After class, I talked to the teacher about the volume of the curriculum and had no comments, so she agreed with my feelings. It was also unpleasant for me that they had a freshman in front of a history paper and that a young lady used a music lesson to prepare for a paper and consulted with her classmates, which was quite disturbing. So how to deal with these situations? Leave them because it's just an education (from which someone can graduate) or set strict rules that this is not possible in class?

5391	But not crucial. I didn't like school very much from the beginning. She didn't look good on me. The teachers were nice and friendly, but I didn't like the style of teaching they practice there. I have experience from two teachers, so I can't judge if the others are teaching like that.	She didn't look good on me.	Feeling	[2, 5]
5476	At the end of the lesson, the teacher asked me how it went, if they were nice. That quite amused me. They are also good, I would not like to condemn them right away, but they also behaved in the same way during the listening. . .

I would not like to condemn them immediately, but even during the listening they behaved the same ...	Feeling	[3, 3]
3008	The others at least began to nod after my call. To be sure, I asked a sharper student to summarize orally in Czech what they should do. I don't like to use this method of authentication, but I didn't know what to do in this situation. It is more than clear to me that I will have to focus even more on this area and realize what I can do differently next time.

4835	I say, at least something, but so little? And the other three had nothing at all, they just sat and did nothing. I didn't understand much. I didn't understand why the teacher didn't tell them anything. Somehow she crossed them and, of course, went around the whole class several times, but she didn't tell them anything. She let them do their thing.	I didn't understand why the teacher didn't tell them anything.	Reflection	[2, 2]
5368	So I gave up, opened the workbook and went to workout from the workplace. Another thing that surprised me was how quickly I switched from German instructions to Czech. They didn't even slowly understand the page number in the textbook, so I slipped into Czech. It's bad, I know, but they're in nine, most of them don't want to see German in their lives anymore, so I won't stress there.	They didn't even slowly understand the page number in the textbook, so I slipped into Czech.	Difficulty	[6, 3]
840	The day before, I had consulted the teacher about the subject matter I should discuss in class. She let me into the classroom an hour ago and I could get everything I needed. The nervousness was considerable, mainly to keep the discipline in the classroom and to give the students the most interesting curriculum. The lesson was divided into two areas. At the beginning of the lesson, what the quotes are repeated. I also showed students the ability to create citations using citation generators, such as citations. com.

6384	I've seen a few dictionaries and some really don't. It's either because they have some dysfunction, or simply because they're not paying attention. Nervousness is a very unpleasant thing.

2413	And the two boys were rolling around and beating their notebooks. So I took the notebook from them. She sat down between them, thinking it would be enough. Not enough.

1823	I must say that I have probably had the greatest success with this activity in this class so far.

1895	They do not understand why this student is called preferentially when he reports. Why is this student entrusted with so much trust on the part of the teacher, when it is the student who is disturbing.

6110	Some students required (from September to about December or January) a written question on the board. What I asked them soon forgot about the phonological loop. They did not keep more than about six words in their working memory. Since about January or February, I have not written questions to them on the board. I noticed that they already understood what I was asking, and they answered right away.	They did not keep more than about six words in their working memory.	Other	[5, 6]

856	As for the lessons I have taught, I feel that I cannot teach so naturally. I can't scream when students are angry in class. I can't catch the time yet, I have no idea how long the activity lasts, so I have to try and learn it. I'm also learning what a circle with fifteen students looks like in space, because I've never focused on it. I can't naturally switch from one activity to another.

5915	"I have to stop smiling. I also realize that I was lucky that my student's mother allowed me to leave him after school. I can't imagine the consequences if I publicly promised him in front of everyone that he would stay after school, and then I couldn't keep my ""threat"" due to my parents' disagreement. But I obviously solved the situation badly, because a similar situation was repeated for another hour. He got four from a paper he didn't learn."

Reflection	[6, 3]
5354	Even more skilful children agreed to this and, according to the teacher, they were even happy that they would really repeat and experience everything. I can't imagine being able to observe this and come up with the most appropriate method in my teaching beginnings. For the time being, I am replacing the role of assistant in these classes. The assisted student initially reacted negatively, but over the course of the lesson he was glad that there was someone to help him.	I can't imagine being able to observe this and come up with the most appropriate method in my teaching beginnings.	Difficulty	[3, 3]
2489	In my opinion, not paying attention to mistakes can harm them in the future, especially for children from selected groups. In the third and fourth groups, the aim is to talk to children and to equip them linguistically so that they can communicate abroad, and in this case I understand such a method of assessment.

6192	In science, the circulatory system was discussed, and the teacher wanted the children to read a paragraph in the textbook and tell her what they had learned. She kept calling the aforementioned boy, who was silent, and he could be seen sitting nervously and huddled in a chair. However, the teacher still did not stop and gave him a lecture on how he has no chance to master the 6th grade and that he is incompetent. . .

4849	I would also like to describe my perception of two autistic people. Each of them was in a different class. The first was very noisy with expressive gestures.

3949	"I really think that even if I had the tests corrected, I would play it and apparently forget the papers. This is learning through play. The students devoured my every word. It makes sense to teach! I am constantly solving educational problems in ""my class"". I don't know what to do next. I tried it for good.

2869	The main problem in the first lesson, in my opinion, was the inadequacy of my demands on students. I didn't realize that ninth graders also need to say what and when to do exactly. Otherwise, the hour turned out better than I expected.	I didn't realize that ninth graders also need to say what and when to do exactly.	Difficulty	[4, 3]
360	The teacher gives me a lot of freedom, she often doesn't even go to class with me, she asks if I don't mind. . I don't mind, I think I should be able to take an hour on my own, but it's not easy.

2979	I'll probably have to divide them into smaller groups and put something different for everyone, or just come up with a different way to work with them. Moreover, I don't like their class, where the benches are classically in rows, but before we moved them to UÄka and then back, we wouldn't have time to do anything else at that hour. In addition, it quite limits me that I don't know them all by name, because when I want to address or call someone, I go after the name on the name tag.

4811	That it's just awful. The second time I taught in that class, I called her up again. I didn't give up, trying to get her to answer. In the end, she told me at least part of it. I praised her, I showed great enthusiasm. As all books on pedagogy say, learning is a natural process for children.	I didn't give up, trying to get her to answer.	Experience	[6, 4]
1881	The students only found a topic on wikipedia, wrote two sentences on a piece of paper and then read them to the class. It was obvious that they didn't even understand what they were reading to the class. He doesn't know if it's normal in this elementary school, but it seemed terribly sold to me. I hope to collect more situations in the next reflective diary and to be able to write it down. How do I feel about my own lessons? So they start from the beginning.

1541	I just shook my head and continued quickly, because there was nothing I could do when they were out of school and people were turning over who the teacher they were offering marijuana to was. I don't know what to do at such moments, because the school does not have a clear procedure and is quite benevolent, because it does not want to cause problems for the students, because it would not solve anything. The next day I had a conversation with them and since then it's been fine, they themselves admitted that it was across the line.

6017	The only problem was that we didn't have much time to discuss everything I wanted to talk to them about. Suddenly I wondered how short 45 minutes was. I don't know about the children, but the lesson escaped me very quickly. I'm quite surprised during the breaks in the cabinet. I always wondered how the teacher must be preparing for further classes or correcting tests during breaks.	I don't know about the children, but the lesson escaped me very quickly.	Reflection	[5, 4]

2982	My feelings from practice are still mixed. I feel an instinct to save all the children from the school system and boring hours, but it's very difficult to handle. I just don't know how to do it. What the teacher didn't tell me after the first lesson, but my classmate, who was also in the lesson, was that I can't approach the children at school individually.	I just don't know how to do it.	Difficulty	[2, 4]
4942	Now I don't understand why I thought about it like that, but it's nothing. I feel weird thinking about such a thing at all. But I still wonder where the limits are.

5344	In the eighth grade, there is a boy with autism who is completely out of it. Why should kids like him bother with another language?

429	Terrible. I wouldn't be nervous about the whole class and I would give an ultimatum that either everyone would listen immediately or get a five.

2158	In a word, it's cool. However, I did not expect that there could be such a difference in the students. For the first two weeks, the students were very kind, and it was weird.

3846	History I had high expectations from history lessons and I was looking forward to them. Unfortunately, I was not pleasantly surprised. The lessons are taught by a young teacher shortly after graduation. I wasn't expecting an experienced and seasoned educator, but at least I expected him to diversify his lessons by working with different media. However, its interpretation is based only on dry reading from a textbook or classical frontal teaching. No PowerPoint, no pictures, no books, no replicas. . .

Well, it was a lesson - next time to calculate all the examples before I stand in front of the children. Last week I reported an observation from the faculty.

1158	Three students brought yogurt! I don't get it! When we did this in high school, everyone was excited to stuff their classmate like a goose, but they're not interested. Well, OK. . . in the end they somehow took turns. Then I had a discussion scheduled where the students would describe my feelings about feeding. How they felt in the role of a medic and in the role of a patient. What they liked or didn't like. . . Yes!	Well ... in the end, they somehow took turns.	Other	[5, 5]

Even so, there was still concern about how they would react to the new teacher.	Feeling	[3, 5]
2044	I am also sure of my mistakes in explaining, I will put more emphasis on explaining the activity, I will go through one sample QR code with them. And the motivation could have been better. Well, as you can see, the teaching can be different. Somewhere it works better, somewhere worse. And I will learn for a long time to know how to do it. Juchuuu - the last reflective diary! However, I will return to practice.	Well, as you can see, the teaching can be different.	Other	[6, 6]
4280	Without giving more weight to this before, I found that one of the most important qualities of a teacher is the ability to empathize and understand. I'm in practice. Well, as an internship, I've been working as an assistant at a primary school for three years now, so I don't think my current classroom instruction can be called an internship. I have a great advantage over my classmates, because I have seen and experienced a lot. As a teaching assistant, I tried to teach a lot of lessons in various subjects.

23	Of course, then she remarked on all this to make sure that she understood that I was young, the girls were young, but some weren't even 15. Well, I just laughed at that, because I didn't really think about something like that: D. But what influenced me the most was the moment when she told me that the children would like me to stay there and teach them every hour.

2342	I had a lot of fun, the students were great. They reported, answered questions, did not disturb. Simply the lesson every teacher dreams of. But then came physics class in the seventh grade. We've been discussing movement together for some time. I am very proud of the preparations on this topic, as I have often managed to alternate between different activities.	But then came physics class in the seventh grade.	Other	[6, 6]
24	Perhaps the whole class there started saying (some shouting) how much they look forward to teaching them. Anyway, I must have blushed at that moment: D and he didn't even know what to say, so I just smiled with a little joy that they were taking me like this right from the start. I then sat down on the last bench and watched what was going on around me and how the lesson was going.

3539	It was a couple of light exercises in Excel. Well, I will not lie, I met with resistance and reluctance to the exercise. Questions like what it's going to be for them, that they won't need this, that they don't want to do this, etc. , it sounded from the children 's mouths several times.

4773	I confided in this problem to the accompanying teacher and I was reassured that this situation is not me, but they are said to be passive all the time.

5596	Well, we kind of talked about it, and I knew in advance that the lessons with her would probably not be quite bright, and maybe I personally expected a little change in her performance, but it's exactly as it was before and how I remember it myself. Cold, uncompromising, hard and most of all unpopular with the vast majority of children.

3953	When I told her that excel was the main thing they worked with in economics, she still reacted that she would not need this in her life. Well, I gradually got to the core of this problem with the children - it was their teacher, which they had from the sixth to the eighth grade, and who is also their class teacher. He praises him for being a great teacher. Great in the sense that he doesn't want anything from them.

1067	Immediately a week later, I had Associate Professor KratochvÃ­lovÃ¡, the head of the department, at the lesson. Well, of course, I was nervous when there were even two of me at that class, both the associate professor and my accompanying teacher. I say to myself, I'm not going to prepare anything extra, I'm glad I can get the lessons ready, but I don't want to look like I coughed it up again.

3995	I'm not lucky in this practice, and I'm actually a little happy about it. I'm afraid it will probably be harder for me than younger students. Well, we'll see in the next semester.

1560	First of all, she asked me what my approval was, and when I replied that I had a TE for OV, she answered me in a polite way, what the hell was my approval.

4091	So next time I will apologize to the students, I will only mark the illustrations and we will no longer implement the leaflet. We will move to the second Adobe Photoshop program. Well, I have to prepare a lot for that. The class begins. I stand at the department, the teacher writes in the classroom and says that she is giving me the floor. I will write the theme of the clock on the board and underline it. I don't even know why I'm doing this.	Well, I have to prepare a lot for that.	Intention	[3, 2]	K

2787	It is already a lot to print one page for each student. This surprised me a little, mainly because the teacher told me at the first meeting that it was not a problem to print anything. Well, it's not. When it's not enough. So I reduced the other worksheets to A5 format so that one page would be published for two students.	Well, it's not.	Other	[5, 7]
2072	I will get acquainted with the classes for the first hours and then immediately use my presence and the teaching will be in my hands. Well, actually, I wasn't very pleased, but I didn't want to oppose her, so I nodded. I had hearings on Friday, Monday and Wednesday. I wrote down all the teacher's activities and procedures as wild.

5340	When I came to school, I didn't have to be too nervous yet. I was waiting for Viking lessons. Well, that's a topic, that's something for me. I think I quite attracted the students. I watched for an hour, which didn't suit me very well lately, but this time I hit almost exactly.	Well, that's a topic, that's something for me.	Other	[5]
6758	One was even turned back so often that I knew him by the face, and the girls and I were sitting on the last bench. Well, I couldn't wait to do something in that hive.

I know that I am full of ideals, but still, I go to work in a group, where I also meet children with similar diagnoses, but it always helps me to talk to children about the problem completely openly (without examples of animals).

1513	You know how pleased I was. Well, she included me in a number of positive attributes, until I started to blush. Normally I would still teach.

6196	The teacher gives him the opportunity to improve the grade, chooses a topic for him and he coughs it up. Normally he said that he did not and will not prepare the paper in the end. And what now?

2057	I have had and will have to regret absenteeism in some subjects, especially on Mondays, which is a paradox, because I have a seminar on practice on Monday.

417	I was also worried about being able to speak normally in front of the whole class. I motioned for the accompanying teacher to intervene to notice my desperate looks and try to help me in some way. It must be added that both my teachers did not disappoint me again and encouraged me.

However, we did not enjoy the listening very much, and I consider it beneficial, the teacher tries to involve us as much as possible in teaching, either as assistants or as independent and joint teachers. Now on Friday we had the opportunity to teach 3 hours on the topic of Halloween. So I actually studied with my classmate in tandem.

5815	However, I think the biggest problem is the fact that we are not able to lower our language level to a level close to the students - ie. the same or at least similar. Subsequently, it is very difficult for a person to look for the most basic words and phrases that students would fully understand and would not be a problem for them.

3528	At the beginning of my reflection, I would start with feedback from my new students. The head teacher Michal has more lessons with the students, so he asked about my first lesson. He then told me that it was interesting for the students, but that they had not learned much in the program and rather only repeated what they already knew. This situation happened mainly due to lack of information. Michal didn't quite remember everything he discussed with the students last year, even though he sent me a list of the material covered.

Activity zero, it was practically only the interpretation of the teacher. But it is quite possibly caused by the teacher's output and interpretation - I didn't enjoy it at all and how many times I thought that many things could be done differently to motivate children to concentrate more on the lesson and arouse their interest in the issue. But it was a general interpretation without emotion, and it can't entertain anyone. After an hour, I said goodbye to the children and said we would see each other again in a week.

4162	Throwing the ball to the students who answer the questions. This is something that I consider a great practice for practice and students will definitely appreciate it. It may sound simple to many to prepare a lesson to entertain the pupils, but it is very difficult for me when I want to talk about something in the lesson or explain to the pupils, involve something fun in it.

6853	But how should such a situation be handled only by the teacher himself? He needs to teach the subject and teach the children something. It is really not in his power to constantly admonish everyone, whether to concentrate or walk through the whole class, if they have added the correct word that was written on the board without mistakes.

6845	The lessons I had to teach were very difficult for me to practice. Before the first lesson I was supposed to teach on the second lesson on Wednesday, I was very nervous. The teacher I encouraged me to practice and said that there was nothing wrong with it, that the first lessons were always the worst, but then I would enjoy it. That's exactly how it was. The hour was on time zones, but it passed like three minutes. At the end of the lesson, I just thought I would go on.

681	But the last hour of this day completely killed me. On that day, the second NJ teacher did not come to school, so all German groups had to merge. The teacher asked me if I would stop by for the first ten minutes, because she had to do something with one parent, and that I would definitely be able to do it with the assistant. But. . .

3484	From his narration, I found out that most children in the class have a social and disciplinary problem. The principal put all the problem pupils in one class, so there were really extreme cases.

5495	Right from the beginning of the lesson, when I was still with the teacher, I noticed that, with a few exceptions, the whole class is quite scattered and they don't want to work much. The teacher probably didn't mind much, she just occasionally reprimanded them whether they were doing or talking more than they were drawing, but that's the end of it. It struck me that she didn't even explain to the students what topic to draw. She just said they would draw chess and that was it. No motivation. Maybe that's why the students don't like it.

2032	I can say that students have no reason to be afraid in any way, because reprimand always takes place in a constructive way and not in an offensive style. The teacher is able to combine the role of actor and expert in one person, which is more than desirable for a lively form of teaching the Czech language.

2762	So these are the positive findings in the beginning of the practice, which I had to appreciate. On the other hand, I was acquainted with the opposite findings. In my opinion, the teacher is unnecessarily exhausting her voice, which I do not consider to be good at all for her future teaching career. I didn't like it when someone interrupted or did other activities on the desk than they were given, the teacher rather overlooked it.

647	Because the matter of aesthetics is a subjective thing, I think it's great that children can express their opinions.

It starts in pairs, continues through groups of four students to the whole class, and students are diligently looking for what they have in common and speak exclusively English together.

4205	Sometimes I felt more like a circus attraction than a teacher. I always thought that the purpose of teaching was to teach students something and not to entertain them at school.

After that, I gave a theoretical introduction to the topic of global change, which concerns environmental change and climate change in general. We use textbooks from Fraus, there at the beginning of this topic I was interested in an article entitled - Can climate change in Syria in the Arab Spring?

2355	This was followed by a discussion on the topic of emotions, where the student and I asked each other what emotions exist. After that, we freely got to the topic of fear, when I wanted the students to expressively portray what they are most afraid of. Since this is a relatively sensitive topic, I was a little worried.

4814	Indeed, this lesson was very nicely prepared, but unfortunately the students did not appreciate it and were constantly disturbing. The only thing they could do was sing, which didn't take place until the end of the class. After this lesson, the teacher asked me if I wanted to teach in this class, so I decided to accept this challenge. I admit I'm scared already.

2007	The following month, the sixth grade deals with the theme of birds, with owls being the first to arrive. The children were stunned by their negative attitude. After assigning the task, most of the class fell into the complaint that they could not do it, do not know what an owl looks like, etc. It often happened that the children asked us to draw an owl for them, either me or the teacher.

5387	To think that I am the teacher and they are the students, I found it quite strange. But if I really say to myself that I am the one who has the school-leaving examination (and also the bachelor's degree in the given field), I am the person who can prepare them for the school-leaving examination and get them to it. That gets better now. It is important to be able to look at things from different angles. . . From the very first lesson in practice, I had quite conflicting feelings.

5317	So I really like that Ifka focuses on the current needs of the student within the activity. If a student is groping in some grammar or repeatedly mispronouncing a word, it is better to dwell on a specific problem than to overlook it. The student might think that he is not making a mistake, or that the teacher is focusing on himself and not on him. I would like to apply this approach next time.

5558	My kind of conclusion of all my previous practice is that I would really like to try teaching in high school. If the work is just as or even more demanding than I have had a chance to know so far, I will probably still have to think about whether to start a teaching career. On the other hand, it would be a shame to lose a lot of great experiences and experiences that I know I will not get anywhere else.

5193	At the same time, they were prepared for what was expected of them. This is not usually the case with conventional animation programs. If the time comes out and the seventh grade class allows, I will have two more hours with the class, I would like to continue working from the gallery. If not, they will make Christmas school decorations. In this reflection, I would like to think a little more about the teaching profession and the general purpose of the internship in the follow-up master's degree.

6367	The teacher asks the questions to the students, but it occurs to me that she is not interested in the answer at all and continues to interpret as she prepared it. If he enters an activity in the style of add to the exercises, work in groups, change your mind, etc. It does not leave pupils enough time to fill in and goes on for inspection almost immediately. He is then surprised that the students are not catching up and tells them that they are terribly slow.

1948	This surprised me a little, but then it occurred to me that they were only quarters, and yet they still couldn't have such a general overview. I tried to clarify this concept to them through a comparison from our history, ie. Prague Spring and at least in the simplicity to tell them that the term Arab Spring is the collective name for the revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East in the last 10 years.

5503	They were excited. When asked how they would perform the crayfish canon, they immediately responded correctly. They also performed polyphony with independent voices. Everyone danced their part.

They also performed polyphony with independent voices.	Other	[6, 6]
1568	"At the same time, the technique ""baked"" me a bit in the class when I had a conceited exercise. Gradually, I lost my energy and desire to do something else. We slowly went through the exercises and managed about 1/3 of my plan. On the contrary, the lesson was calmer on Thursday, but I had considerably lost my strength (not sleeping, duties associated with the faculty, preparation for elementary school lessons)."

587	I was taken aback and quite sad. After all, an artist should be an object where everyone can be themselves, where no one has to close themselves in. Slowly, the students were finishing their work, and I encouraged them to start cleaning the classroom so that we had 15 minutes left to reflect on the lesson. Everyone who had a finished creation had to put their work in front of the board.

1952	Really very challenging. But what I didn't know was that the children were not divided into groups, so English is taught in this large number, in addition to integrated pupils. Help! Really? How is this even manageable? The initial impression made me desperate and hopeless that I could never do this, teach such a class anything at all.	Help!	Other	[7, 5]

3161	Unlike the last hour, where she was very active, still spinning, talking to a roommate or to herself, now she was very tired and obviously sleepy. I thought she spent the night about the night.

Reflection	[4, 5]
1279	That seemed strange to me. Even after repeated reprimands, he did not close his mouth. The other students also reprimanded him - most of the class was actively involved in teaching, which I enjoyed immensely. I thought he was probably disturbing every hour that I probably couldn't do much. After class, I talked to the accompanying teacher. She confirmed to me that both students were violators of the class order.	I thought he was probably disturbing every hour that I probably couldn't do much.	Belief	[2, 4]
1721	How much he clings to marks and fulfillment of curricula and external requirements, he forgets such things as motivation, conscious development of students, feedback and reflection. . .

6352	I have to overcome that timidity and get used to it. Even if I don't teach at all, I think it's a good training for life. I helped a group of guys who didn't enjoy it much.

3772	I was very sympathetic to the teacher's attitude. She treated him as an equal, using nothing of her authority as a teacher and student. Monday's hearings were beneficial for me not only from the point of view of leading the lesson, but also from the point of view of non-traditional situations at school, which I will certainly encounter more than once in my life. The kids took me! That was the first thing that came to my mind during and after the internship. I go there regularly, mostly to the same and the same classes.

465	Recently, in one class, I managed to explain the curriculum in such a way that it was understood even by a child who had struggled with it for a long time and did not understand it. In fact, I felt more happy than the student. But I didn't mind at all. I don't think he wanted to show his joy in front of his classmates, even though they supported him very nicely and were happy with him.	In fact, I felt more happy than the student.	Feeling	[5, 3]
4943	I was surprised by his question if I was not afraid of him. I didn't even realize I should be scared at all. In fact, he didn't even seem to hurt anyone.

855	I find the selection of a textbook for teaching more and more important. At this school, they learn according to the textbook Vite 1 and 2. I really don't understand how they could have chosen it as the most suitable. Neither me nor the teacher suits me at all. Preparing for lessons takes about three times as long when you want to teach according to a textbook than when you create your own activity from the beginning.

5288	My ideas about how I would imagine teaching science or chemistry vanished. I felt like I was from another world. In fact, it disgusted me all day, I still had to think about it.

1204	Paradoxically, I consider the best hour to ever forget that I should come and not prepare anything 'proper'. It was a 6th grade lesson, a two-hour morning class. The theme of the lesson was writing. For the first time, there were no pre-printed materials and patterns, which I think dramatically changed the students' approach to the topic.

I sat in the back and watched quietly as the music lessons went on. After only two hours, I found out that the structure of teaching is very similar in all classes. At the beginning, there are two papers. Pupils report on their favorite band or singer.	I sat in the back and watched quietly as the music lessons went on.	Experience	[4, 5]
2874	The new accompanying teacher directed me to think of a plane that I would have completely neglected at the meeting of all circumstances.

4581	But in short, the students were always very noisy, asked disproportionate questions, and worked a little slower than I would expect from ninth and eighth graders. But lately, it seems to me that the students are a little calmer here. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm used to it. In math class it is another oasis.

3930	I would like to dedicate the last diary to one of the strongest experiences I have had the opportunity to experience in practice - this time it will be a positive experience.

The last lesson in practice was also my last lesson, which I led myself.	Experience	[4, 5]
2123	Unfortunately, I must state that this teaching is still unchanged. The teacher relies on the effect of frontal teaching and does not involve any media in his interpretation. The last hour with him was still hampered by his bad mood. Although the students he was currently teaching had no effect on his negative mood, it was still reflected in his behavior towards them.	The last hour with him was still hampered by his bad mood.	Feeling	[4, 4]

2945	I think the floor at school is pretty cold and it's not good for children to run barefoot all day. In addition, there is a greater risk of slipping and injuries. The last negative situation that stuck in my head took place in the eighth grade (it's a dys class, so we have to take it into account, but it still seemed crazy to me).

Then I wondered if I should have acted differently, but nothing occurred to me. That day I had another surveillance experience. There is a student in the class who sometimes has tantrums.

6417	On the day I started my internship, I was very sympathetic to the director. He was very accommodating, gave us a welcome hand and gave an introductory speech. Then I felt more relaxed. Subsequently, an assigned accompanying teacher came for me, who will accompany me through the subject of history. I immediately went to see the introductory class with him.	Then I felt more relaxed.

3017	At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher took over what they did last time and understood the material that I will teach them. It was less than five minutes. Then I took over the substance. I had the same beginning as in the ninth grade. Introduction and setting of rules. The students agreed to me, but also complied.	Then I took over the substance.	Experience	[5, 5]
198	I was nervous and afraid that I would be embarrassed in front of the students and I would not be able to manage the game positively and ensure its successful course. . . But then I said to myself that I could slightly adjust the rules, as I thought was most effective for the topic (practicing numbers up to 100). After all, what is it all about? The teacher works independently with the second group and my task is to practice the topic with the students so that it is effective.	But then I said to myself that I could slightly adjust the rules, as I thought was most effective for the topic (practicing numbers up to 100).	Experience	[4, 4]
646	So I wanted to repeat the words from the previous lessons in a slightly active way. Then I put on a pre-borrowed, ridiculously large leatherette jacket for this purpose, on which I tried to demonstrate to the students as realistically as possible the two above-mentioned constructions. Then, instead of myself, I let the accompanying teacher drown in my jacket to make it even clearer. This was followed by listening to the conversation, which of course included the constructions.

687	My last hour of the day followed - music education (7th B) I met familiar faces in class. At the beginning, I defined the concept of spiritual and secular music, briefly wrote it in a notebook.

7105	I let her go for a while and asked him to speak more. I didn't want to threaten her or try to satisfy her with external motivation, that wouldn't make sense to me. Then we moved on to the creation itself, which was a collage where the pupils connected the image and the text and tried to transfer the ordinary theme to something extraordinary. TÃ½na completely refused to start working. I tried to convince her with a smile on her face, at least to try.

4435	I sat in the back of the bench and watched the class. She was to be killed. The students were having fun, the teacher tried to shout at them as she wanted, but it was a valid mushroom. Then, of course, everyone asked about twenty times what to do. The teacher was very sorry for her, she is not much older than me, so I sympathized with her. I'd rather slap the students or steam them.	Then, of course, everyone asked about twenty times what to do.	Other	[5, 6]

3861	It is true that the students were very noisy. I tried to keep them quiet, to captivate them. At the beginning of the lesson, the doctor spoke to the students about indiscipline. Then, during the process, she took the three most disturbing boys out of class and arranged for them. I think that the activities I prepared for them were fun for the students.

2469	In the morning I thought about how to change the prepared lessons so that my voice was spared as much as possible. Everything bad is good for something. I needed to explain the polyphony and find an activity to rest my vocal cords. An idea was born. The class I was to teach was composed mostly of hockey players.

4985	I am mostly satisfied with my lessons. I'm not saying that everything will turn out exactly as I plan, but usually there will be no unsolvable problem in class. Only once was I slightly scattered from the class. However, it was not the behavior of the students in my lesson, but the fact that the students did not understand the new subject in chemistry, namely the nomenclature of oxygen acids.	Only once was I slightly scattered from the class.	Feeling	[5, 6]
338	When I was teaching with the same students, they were able to work almost without problems. I just had a problem with a student who didn't want to work.

828	After class, I received positive feedback from the accompanying teacher that he liked it. Which made me very happy, because I was quite nervous before my first hour.

1703	What kind of German teacher would I give in elementary school? She is very energetic and tries to attract students, sometimes she succeeds more sometimes sometimes less. He uses a lot of gestures and facial expressions, which sometimes helps a lot. And when I think about it like that, I would like to use it during teaching as well. It'll probably take a while for me not to feel like a jerk.	He uses a lot of gestures and facial expressions, which sometimes helps a lot.	Other	[5, 3]

3477	On the contrary, I expected it, I believed more in history. I evaluate the OV lessons I taught very positively. I left them with a feeling of a job well done. I managed to attract the pupils much better, they enthusiastically got involved in the prepared activities, I was even able to draw some of my own opinions from them. In class D, the pupils were passive, but in OV I managed to activate them. Overall, I see past practice as very beneficial for my future profession.

Positive motivation doesn't work, punishment doesn't work, ignoring doesn't work, reporting behind the door doesn't work, bargaining or trying to talk have led nowhere.

3261	Observing this lesson gave me the impression that even teachers who have been practicing their profession for many years are not able to conduct tandem teaching as I thought it should look, whether it is due to a lack of competencies or purely for the sake of that tandem teaching is a commonly unusable technique in school practice due to its impracticality and time consuming (if it should be sufficiently coordinated).

3486	Before the lesson starts, I say to myself that the students are still small, so they will be cute and kind. However, after the first few minutes, I find that it is exactly the opposite. In my opinion, the topic is interesting, but the students who are sitting in the last desks draw, model plasticine, throw papers at each other and still giggle at something.

We go through the worksheets together, but there is still noise in the classroom. If I'm standing in front, they talk in the back. If the opposite is true, the situation is the same.

5632	Pupils actively work here, cooperate with the teacher and overall most students try. Sometimes I wonder what these students will be like, transformed with the same noisy teenagers as the previous eighth graders? But somehow it doesn't suit me.

The accompanying teacher gave me valuable feedback right after the lesson and suggested that I be able to teach a lesson with the same topic in a parallel class of the 7th grade. We slightly adjusted the preparation for this lesson according to their advice. The second class lesson was completely different.

5760	Eight comes on Friday. They are probably the hardest working. An unbelievable mess in class, so they don't do well in German either, but they don't fight at all for at least an hour. Success. The accompanying teacher then told me that this is unfortunately what it looks like in most schools. In her opinion (and other teachers there), a second foreign language for children does not belong in primary school. And after this experience, I find that I completely agree with her.

6775	Not only does it make it difficult for me to set an adequate point limit, but in papers where most children do not study for the test, it makes it difficult for me to find those points at all. The accompanying teacher told me that I should try to always give as many points as possible. I didn't resist because I don't know the students.

3958	It's a nice feeling. This week I taught science again, specifically the sensory system in the 8th grade. I was worried about the large number of pupils in the class, there are 30. I taught a class with 19 pupils in the previous lesson. I tried to prepare thoroughly again and especially to try to involve the students as much as possible, so that it would be at least a little fun.

1784	The teacher employs him with erasing the board and other small things. I watch the team and I don't feel they accept it completely. They do not understand why this student is called preferentially when he reports. Why is this student entrusted with so much trust on the part of the teacher, when it is the student who is disturbing. I have no idea if anyone will ever explain to these students why he is being treated differently. Overall, there is a calm, pleasant atmosphere in the classroom.

5865	The history is talkative, we have a lot of historical films that introduce students to the subject. The citizen is lifeless in this respect. At the same time, I would say that it is more important for the child's future than history. Why is this the case, why does he have only one hour a week, while other subjects are taught more often?

4119	Everything changed completely the next week at the very meetings, where we built a great relationship with the teacher and we made a great deal and everything is fine in terms of organization. The first two weeks of my internship brought me both good and bad knowledge.

332	For the very first hour, we made the mistake of arguing about further activity in front of the children and they were watching us closely. This should be avoided in the future.

762	However, when I came to the class, I was pleasantly surprised, because the student was polite, active and hardworking. I really enjoyed designing the lesson to entertain the students. In the first lesson, the students learned the rest of the support system, which they did not have time to discuss, and the second part was followed by a practical exercise on the flatness of the foot, which also excited me as a student, as we did the same in anthropology class for teachers.

Before the very beginning, the teacher warned me that the boy was having a hard time tolerating change and advised me not to contact him directly, not to address him.	Experience	[3, 4]
5480	At first I didn't know what to do. How to stand up, how to have your hands folded, whether to smile, talk or rather just keep quiet. I still watch a lot in front of students, I constantly think about how I probably influence them. I talked to the girls about the project, answered questions about me and asked them about their hobbies.	I still watch a lot in front of students, I constantly think about how I probably influence them.	Reflection	[6, 4]
4819	So far, I appreciate the most successful music lessons in sports class. I was told in advance not to expect any great performances and to discount my artistic requirements. I admit that I was a little scared an hour ago that she wouldn't be a loser.	I was told in advance not to expect any great performances and to discount my artistic requirements.	Perspective	[3, 5]
4415	I really liked her approach. All the while, I thought to myself that in the future I would like to teach in a similar way to her. She briefly informed me in advance about the classes I went to talk to. Overall, she was very accommodating and dedicated to me. However, I was most interested in the art classroom.	She briefly informed me in advance about the classes I went to talk to.	Experience	[3, 5]
4419	So I have my first lessons behind me. I was the first to learn the topic of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in the 9th A. I was quite nervous. Above all, I was afraid to catch everything we agreed on with the accompanying teacher: to repeat the previous curriculum, to build on the new ones, to make a record with the pupils and to repeat everything at the end of the lesson. P. teacher went to class with me and sat back.	Above all, I was afraid to catch everything we agreed on with the accompanying teacher: to repeat the previous curriculum, to build on the new ones, to make a record with the pupils and to repeat everything at the end of the lesson.	Feeling	[4, 6]
3769	So it was a surprise to me when I met the elements in the admissions lessons that raised questions for me and the need to reflect on my own lessons from the last semester. Above all, these were history lessons, which I also completed significantly more than civics lessons, where I encountered these situations and were primarily situations in the conceptually planned lesson structure and in the effective use of lesson time, compared to the first semester when I focused on pedagogical situations and problems that are to some extent independent of the subject matter, such as climate, motivation, and others. The situation that caused me the need for reflection and which I want to address in the first diary entry was related to the topic of World War II.	Above all, these were history lessons, which I also completed significantly more than civics lessons, where I encountered these situations and were primarily situations in the conceptually planned lesson structure and in the effective use of lesson time, compared to the first semester when I focused on pedagogical situations and problems that are to some extent independent of the subject matter, such as climate, motivation, and others.	Experience	[3, 5]
3583	"Above all, I liked how the teacher was able to regulate the difficulty of the curriculum and divide the curriculum into more complex and simpler, while it was easier to teach in the afternoon and more demanding in the morning, when the students are ""fresh"". I really liked this stylization of the difficulty of the material, that a certain logic and system was clear in the structure of their lessons."	"Above all, I liked how the teacher was able to regulate the difficulty of the curriculum and divide the curriculum into more complex and simpler, while it was easier to teach in the afternoon and more demanding in the morning, when the students are ""fresh""."	Feeling	[4, 5]
942	Especially in the 6th and 7th grade, I noticed with the accompanying teacher that her lessons are more or less boring and the activities flow only from the textbook. and 7th grade, I noticed with the accompanying teacher that her lessons are more or less boring and the activities flow only from the textbook.

5650	"I usually help him the most in mathematics, physics, chemistry and also a lot in English. He handles subjects where he only has to ""learn something"" and does not have to think about some formulas and more complex operations, but in the others he has big problems. But everyone at school sees that he is trying, so they do not want to make it difficult for him and would like him to ""sail"" somehow."	"He handles subjects where he only has to ""learn something"" and does not have to think about some formulas and more complex operations, but in the others he has big problems."	Other	[5, 6]
119	But since then, I've found that textbooks are definitely not everything. She is shapeless. It assumes what students will not be interested in that the authors have not seen. It assumes that students will attend regularly, and in time, and none of them apply to my type of teaching. In this case, the textbook is in a way a brake, mainly because the students do not own the textbook and I can hardly expect them to do homework.	It assumes that students will attend regularly, and in time, and none of them apply to my type of teaching.	Other	[4, 6]
6980	But was it right to give them the punishment they were to bring for another hour? In addition, if the teacher normally gives such punishments, I assume that once the boys have confessed, they must have suspected that such a punishment would come. In retrospect, I thought that I could at least suggest a slightly different solution to the teacher.	I suppose once the boys confessed, they must have known that some such punishment would come.	Belief	[3, 3]
5055	Another factor may be that we only had one hour to enter the topic and the initial work, instead of the classic two. Before that, the competition was evaluated and other unusual things were solved. Maybe she did her own group work and my position in the class is not strong enough. Still, some of the work looks promising and I wonder how the kids will finish it.	Before that, the competition was evaluated and other unusual things were solved.	Other	[6, 6]
5659	She gave the other students pairs of terms that were related in some way. Subsequently, the students were released back and had to find the pairs that belonged together correctly. She demonstrated that the material can be repeated without tests and in a fun way. The atmosphere of the class was very positive. Pupils enjoyed participating in the activity and the lesson was pleasant.	She demonstrated that the material can be repeated without tests and in a fun way.	Other	[6, 5]
2508	The teacher led the lesson. I suggested that if necessary, I would sit next to the mentioned student and try to work with him. I was surprised by his question if I was not afraid of him. I didn't even realize I should be scared at all. In fact, he didn't even seem to hurt anyone.	I was surprised by his question if I was not afraid of him.	Feeling	[6, 5]
4560	I was surprised by the willingness of the teacher. If anyone didn't understand something, he asked, and the teacher explained it to him once more. And with all kindness. Emphasis is also placed on correct pronunciation.	I was surprised by the willingness of the teacher.	Feeling	[6, 5]
2763	She is more in charge of us, but she is happy to answer our questions. The first hour on Friday we were listening in her class. I was surprised at how little the six people understood the instructions and questions in English.	I was surprised at how little the six people understood the instructions and questions in English.	Feeling	[4, 6]
4027	But during the lesson, otherwise inactive students also took part in the climate discussion. We have discussed a wide range of issues addressing global issues. I was surprised at how similar and advanced their views are on their age. We agreed on many topics. But at the same time, they were able to discuss topics where our views diverged.	I was surprised at how similar and advanced their views are on their age.	Feeling	[4, 5]
5099	The second class told me the same thing. During the next Czech lesson, I gave the children quiz questions from Czech, which they solved in pairs and which tested their previous knowledge. I was surprised by a certain division into different poles. One group of children solved my tasks very easily and had everything done soon without major obstacles. The second group of Wednesday or average solved the tasks as I expected.	I was surprised by a certain division into different poles.	Feeling	[5, 5]
1114	After the exam, the students shared their knowledge and new surprising findings. I evaluate this activity very positively. The teacher supports pupils' development in the field of information and data retrieval. I was surprised at how well some students can work with the atlas. They easily found the appropriate map, orientated themselves in the legend and wrote down adequate essential information.	I was surprised at how well some students can work with the atlas.	Feeling	[2, 5]
4603	The teacher confided to me that she did not have an approbation for art education, but because she enjoyed drawing and painting, she decided to devote herself to these classes. I was surprised when she told me that she likes to spend her free time on Pinterest, where she looks for inspiration for children in art classes. It occurred to me that he would spend a lot of time on homework and thus won my admiration.	I was surprised when she told me that she likes to spend her free time on Pinterest, where she looks for inspiration for children in art classes.	Feeling	[5, 5]
1919	Now I only have my own lessons. I clap in the preparations, which take hours and hours of time. I'm slowly looking forward to the exam period, when there will be some calm. I was surprised at how long it takes one preparation, in the meantime it looks so simple, but it's not. . . unless the students just write from the board and do not sit still. I don't want that again, even though a lot of teachers have been teaching like this for so many years. On Tuesday, we will round off the decimal numbers. I'm ready to prepare, so I'm curious how it will turn out.	I was surprised at how long it takes one preparation, in the meantime it looks so simple, but it's not so ... unless the students just write from the board and do not sit still.	Feeling	[4, 4]
6419	She told me that her assistant's behavior didn't suit her, but she hadn't yet figured out a way to work with her in class to make it work. I was surprised that the assistant can thus negatively affect the course of the lesson and the work of the teacher in the classroom. This semester I was thrown directly into practice. After the first hearing, I went to study right away. My first lesson at this school was nothing special.	I was surprised that the assistant can thus negatively affect the course of the lesson and the work of the teacher in the classroom.	Feeling	[4, 5]
6849	When Emilek asked the same question for the twentieth time, I wanted to explode. Not the teacher, however, she lovingly repeated it to him again and drove on. I was surprised that the children showed enormous interest in the curriculum. I don't know if it was me and their effort to show off, but someone kept reporting and eager to answer the question, even if it was total nonsense.	I was surprised that the children showed enormous interest in the curriculum.	Feeling	[5, 5]
5458	The images were simplified, often without details, but more relaxed and distinctive. While in 6B the teacher allowed the use of mobile phones to search for pictures. The resulting drawings looked advanced, but they lacked originality. I was surprised that children can't give feedback.	I was surprised that children can't give feedback.	Feeling	[6, 6]
602	It was a very interesting experience. It is interesting how children behave completely differently on a trip and at school. I was surprised that I remembered the names of everyone quite quickly, even those I didn't know so much yet. I really liked the games and activities that the teachers had for the pupils, ready to unite the team. It was seen that in the course they improved in collective activity.	I was surprised that I remembered the names of everyone quite quickly, even those I didn't know so much yet.	Feeling	[6, 6]
4665	This time I went to the first high school in high school without much expectation. In comparison, the approach of my current accompanying teacher is much closer and more inspiring to me. I was surprised that he introduced me to the class without any prior agreement, which did not happen at all during the previous internship. He explained to the class who I was, why I was in their class, how long I would be attending and that I might ask them something from time to time.	I was surprised that he introduced me to the class without any prior agreement, which did not happen at all during the previous internship.	Feeling	[6, 5]
43	Rather, I would suggest a variant of completing the work in the next lesson, or for homework. I was surprised that such a simple job can last for more lessons. At the end of the lesson, everyone went to the teacher's department for evaluation.	I was surprised that such a simple job can last for more lessons.	Feeling	[6, 5]
2269	Frontal teaching again prevailed, but I only attended grammar lessons, in style or literature it might look different. I was surprised that the students were disciplined, careful, if they disturbed, they were immediately reprimanded. I also regularly went to the supervisions that belonged to the accompanying historian. Second grade classes are not in long corridors, but in a cellular system.	I was surprised that the students were disciplined, careful, if they disturbed, they were immediately reprimanded.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6126	The teacher listened to each output and, if necessary, supplemented or corrected the pupils. I was surprised that the students worked for an hour and did not disturb much.	I was surprised that the students worked for an hour and did not disturb much.	Feeling	[5, 4]
3138	"He was ready for ninth grade, and the test was written on the substance â borrowed words. In the first assignment, students had to add letters to the words. There was the phrase ""famous teater."" I was surprised that the students came up with words like tester, carpenter, subject. Or the word ""manicure"" is added as a mannequin. I would say that words that are generally known have been chosen and that ninth-graders have already had to meet them."	I was surprised that the students came up with words like tester, carpenter, subject.	Feeling	[6, 5]
5214	Surprisingly, it was nice. Although not everything went according to plan, it is clear that it will not work for the first time and it is great to count on it in some way.	Surprisingly, it was nice.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6975	I wonder if I have such claims. I doubt myself and I am furious. Was that even my generation at such a level? Does the famous inclusion have anything to do with this? I ponder those few key moments from today's teaching in my head. It bothers me. Of course, if it was advanced geography, I wouldn't say it either. But so that the pupil in the 6th grade does not know where the south is?	I reflect on those few key moments from today's teaching in my head.	Reflection	[5, 5]
366	So this offer had both its positives and its negatives, and it was clear to me that I would still have to think about it. I thought about this offer for a few days and toyed with the idea of ââtaking this 14-hour part-time job half-time with a classmate, which was originally offered to me, but when I was having fun with a management educator trying to persuade me to take the job myself. Most of the time I thought about the possibility of this work myself, but I also consulted with my friends.

2276	I had an hour in 7th grade for which I came up with a phone stand. I've been wondering which product is the most enticing for a good job, and I think such a phone holder is the best choice. I found a relatively simple product on the Internet, but it looked very good.	I've been wondering which product is the most enticing for a good job, and I think such a phone holder is the best choice.	Reflection	[4, 5]
1596	At that moment, I began to wonder how unfair this was. How could he afford something like that? And how come there's nothing I can do about it? I've been thinking about this event all day. However, bad feelings from an uneducated pupil began to turn into feelings of self-disappointment.	I've been thinking about this event all day.	Reflection	[3, 6]
2963	They liked it, but then they did it anyway. It took them a long time and they were behind the others. I thought about how to get them to work, to motivate them. The teacher dealt with something with the assistant and the children didn't have much fun, so at least I tried it.	I thought about how to get them to work, to motivate them.	Reflection	[4, 6]
4797	I have a pleasant and kind feeling from the children, thanks to which I am not yet very worried about the lessons that I will lead. I was wondering what it would be like in another elementary school, if the fact that these are math classes plays a role, if they are more disciplined, or if it is because the teacher has natural authority, and therefore it is their discipline, in my opinion, in class is good. Oh, my non-working dyslexic. The whole class does not work, it does not work, the teachers took turns, they are of different levels, they have no motivation to work.	I was wondering what it would be like in another elementary school, if the fact that these are math classes plays a role, if they are more disciplined, or if it is because the teacher has natural authority, and therefore it is their discipline, in my opinion, in class is good.	Reflection	[6, 4]
4733	"Because if this bothered them, they would definitely solve it somehow. In fact, in addition to this pupil, the pupils sat around. I wondered in the office if the student was sitting outside or in the back, but not. She is sitting in the middle of class. For an entire lesson, I didn't focus as much on learning as I looked at a student who ""smelled."" I was wondering - what about the other students? What about parents?"	I wondered in the office if the student was sitting outside or in the back, but not.	Reflection	[3, 6]
5262	"She is sitting in the middle of class. For an entire lesson, I didn't focus as much on learning as I looked at a student who ""smelled."" I wondered - what about the other students, what about the parents? What about teachers? Is it being solved or not? If they make it clear to the student. Well, it's my baby, so I handle it."	I was wondering - what about the other students?	Reflection	[5, 7]
4961	It starts to look like a work deformation. I knew that my own lessons awaited me soon and that I should begin to get closer to the children. I wondered how to make contact with them when I realized. I will borrow a textbook from one of the couple. And from the one with which I have the greatest doubts about whether they will accept me as a teacher.	I wondered how to make contact with them when I realized.	Reflection	[6, 4]
1770	The boy was not one of the smartest students in the class, so he wouldn't care if he was tested for punishment. I wondered how else to punish him. At that moment, I began to wonder how unfair this was. How could he afford something like that? And how come I really can't do anything about it?	I wondered how else to punish him.	Reflection	[3, 6]
1866	I wondered what situation I would describe and reflect on in this diary. And it occurred to me that I had (not) managed my very first lesson. From my accompanying teacher, I had the task of planning a 10-15 minute activity for an English lesson.	I wondered what situation I would describe and reflect on in this diary.	Other	[5, 3]
276	I wondered if it was at all possible to keep everyone's attention in such a large group of differently advanced students. Later, I asked my accompanying teacher. She said she was lobbying for the fives to be divided into groups.	I wondered if it was at all possible to keep everyone's attention in such a large group of differently advanced students.	Reflection	[4, 7]
6452	The teacher asked the students how they would solve the example. He deliberately had the students write a mistake on the board (3/4 + 5/6 = / (4 + 6)) and then showed them why they couldn't do it that way. I wondered how many students helped understand why the fractions didn't add up like that, and how many students just messed up their heads. They immediately calculated the example correctly and wrote down a procedure for it. For an hour, I looked at students who were good at math.	I wondered how many students helped understand why the fractions didn't add up like that, and how many students just messed up their heads.	Reflection	[7, 5]
6960	"I wonder how the next lessons will go. I haven't ""caught up"" much yet and I'm curious how teachers and children will react to my own teaching. I wondered what I could write about when nothing special had happened to me in practice so far. Last year I was in practice at a primary school in Brno and there was always something going on, quite often I was shocked by an event and therefore the writing was easy."	I wondered what I could write about when nothing special had happened to me in practice so far.	Reflection	[2, 2]
1619	At the beginning of the lesson, the pupils handed out notebooks with a five-minute note, they were to write down the marks in the ZK and place it on the table. I wondered if it was good to hand out papers at the beginning of class. It occurred to me that the overall distribution and enrollment took the students more time than necessary.	I wondered if it was good to hand out papers at the beginning of class.	Reflection	[5, 5]
5594	"What are my options for ""forcing"" these students to work together? However, after about 5 minutes, the children settled down and prepared the necessary aids. I was wondering if this time is really adequate. I think that a pupil in the 4th grade should already know how it goes at school and that the ringing marks the beginning of the lesson. The class should already know how things are going at school and that the ringing marks the beginning of the class. The lesson traditionally began with a repetition."	I was wondering if this time is really adequate. I think that a pupil in the 4th grade should already know how it goes at school and that the ringing marks the beginning of the lesson.	Reflection	[4, 6]
2125	I sit and wonder if I, as a seventh grade student, made gender differences between teachers. She didn't. I don't think so. I keep thinking and realize that the teacher is very kind, too much. At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher starts rehearsing. It doesn't decide the class, on the contrary, they have even more fun and pretend not to see it.	I keep thinking and realize that the teacher is very kind, too much.	Reflection	[3, 6]
5834	I called the student to the board several times, each time having the same expression. I think about what it is. . . Was it because I was new there and he felt threatened? Was it annoying that I was looking at him when I pointed out inattention?	I think about what it is ...	Reflection	[4, 6]
2656	"Now more or less at all) time. The preparations still take me a lot of time, but I believe that it will all work out somehow. ?? I honestly don't know how to start the last reflection. I think about what I experienced in practice, something I haven't written about so as not to repeat myself. I can only think of the following situations. For the first time, I had to be in favor of a strict ""stocking"". Well, she had to. . . she didn't have to, yes. But at the moment I couldn't think of another solution."	I think about what I experienced in practice, something I haven't written about so as not to repeat myself.	Reflection	[7, 4]
6548	After this lesson, the teacher asked me if I wanted to teach in this class, so I decided to accept this challenge. I admit I'm scared already. I'm wondering what to prepare for the students so that they can enjoy my lesson at all. Fortunately, I'll be teaching in 14 days, so I still have a lot of time to think. Today I taught again in the 7th grade.	I'm wondering what to prepare for the students so that they can enjoy my lesson at all.	Reflection	[6, 4]
5637	She offered me if I wanted to try teaching in this class, and I agreed. I'm respectful and a little worried about that. I'm thinking about how to build a lesson so that the students are as active as possible, but so that the school doesn't fall and I don't stand there as painted.	I'm thinking about how to build a lesson so that the students are as active as possible, but so that the school doesn't fall and I don't stand there as painted.	Reflection	[3, 6]
6802	In my opinion, literary education should be mainly about refining opinions, learning to interpret a text, thinking about it, asking questions. I'm wondering how to teach students. It is probably necessary from the very beginning, on lighter texts, to lead the method of critical thinking to understanding the text, grasping the topic in accordance with their worldview, with their experience.	I'm wondering how to teach students.	Reflection	[6, 4]
991	You know how pleased I was. Well, she included me in a number of positive attributes, until I started to blush. Normally I would still teach. I'm thinkingâ¦ I'll finish my ID and then maybe I'll take another hour on the show. I really enjoy it and now I know I want to do it. A few weeks ago, I had an unexpected success in practice.	I'm thinkingâ¦ I'll finish my ID and then maybe I'll take another hour on the show.	Reflection	[5, 6]
6326	I know it's because they have a different number of chromosomes, but the little girl got involved so that neither the class nor the she knew. I definitely didn't want to interrupt her, because she was arranged with the teacher at the paper. I entered my interpretation with the understanding that we would not be able to discuss everything I wanted to discuss. But the students didn't make it easy for me at all.	I definitely didn't want to interrupt her, because she was arranged with the teacher at the paper.	Experience	[5, 5]
3663	None of them have their own cabinet, as we are used to with newer buildings, but sit together in one large assembly hall. Despite this shortcoming, however, I moved on thanks to the still prevailing positive and friendly atmosphere in the teaching staff.	Despite this shortcoming?	Reflection	[5, 3]
4580	I did not receive a more precise description and instructions, but with tension (especially from my side) we went to class together. The teacher introduced the lesson, introduced her content to the students and then began to explain the game in which I was to assist her.	I did not receive a more precise description and instructions, but with tension (especially from my side) we went to class together.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6647	Thanks to recent experience with my own teaching, I was already more aware of how to prepare for the lesson, what to expect. Still, I was a little nervous. It was a new experience for me to be in class with another teacher.	Still, I was a little nervous.	Feeling	[6, 6]
3735	I spent a lot of time with the fifth grade (4 weeks of listening). They react to me, I think, well, they are communicative, they ask me for my opinion, etc. Nevertheless, when I led the lesson alone, the atmosphere in the classroom was different from when it was led by an accompanying teacher. Personality charm is an exceptional thing when two people do the same thing, it's not the same thing, and it depends on many different little things. The class worked together in my class, but it was much more lively.	Nevertheless, when I led the lesson alone, the atmosphere in the classroom was different from when it was led by an accompanying teacher.	Reflection	[6, 3]
930	"On the other hand, a number of negative situations arise around me. He currently considers interpersonal relationships to be the most difficult of them. I realize that one cannot get along with everyone. Nevertheless, I feel that in one class, negative relationships between students, but mainly between one student and me, strongly affect the course of classes. It is the problem of strong antipathy between me and the student (who is the ""leader"" in the classroom) that bothers me the most."	Nevertheless, I feel that in one class, negative relationships between students, but mainly between one student and me, strongly affect the course of classes.	Feeling	[4, 5]
1815	She was just hoping that Adam would fix the mark today, but lo and behold. The teacher promised his mother that I would be kind, and I don't think I would. Still, I have a bit of mixed feelings. The performance was not number one and I dare say not even number two. Taking into account the teacher's evaluation, I think the trio fits.	Still, I have a bit of mixed feelings.	Feeling	[7, 5]
6057	Before that, the competition was evaluated and other unusual things were solved. Maybe she did her own group work and my position in the class is not strong enough. Still, some of the work looks promising and I wonder how the kids will finish it. I'll see how it goes in the next few hours. With the seventh year, I was in the gallery and came up with an animation program for the exhibition.	Still, some of the work looks promising and I wonder how the kids will finish it.	Feeling	[4, 3]
3848	"I'm a little sorry that the teacher didn't react to it and didn't try to fix it. Still, it was one of the best geography lessons I've ever seen, which is all the sadder.

442	If he happens to have an insidious question, we can find it together today using the Internet. Although I was warned that the bar was low, I did not expect it so low. The problem arose when they had to find America in the atlas. Perhaps only 4 pairs (out of about 15) found her. In the end, I had to dictate the page.	Although I was warned that the bar was low, I did not expect it so low.	Difficulty	[3, 5]
4945	There was always something to do with it, and given the vigor of my nature, I would never expect it to be difficult for me to establish order in class. Nevertheless, perhaps the most difficult thing in practice so far for me was dealing with discipline. But some children are incredibly unruly.	Nevertheless, perhaps the most difficult thing in practice so far for me was dealing with discipline.	Difficulty	[6, 4]
3777	I was very surprised when they brought in a student who was sick and just sat in class anyway. Although the number of students in a class is low compared to mainstream schools, I think that more than ten people with moderate disabilities would be unsuitable for both teachers and students. One student is very hyperactive. Basically, for the whole day, he was unable to sit still, and when that was the case, only on the teacher's order.

2226	We were dealing with what was faster, whether a car or a tractor, and they found it interesting to call a tractor over and over again. Finally, I handed them questionnaires for my teaching. Although I forbade one boy to get up three times and pick them up, he picked them up before the bell rang and before everyone finished writing. I taught in all grades of the second grade. In retrospect, it is interesting to observe that although I was equally strict with all of them, each class perceived me more or less differently.

1720	Such students don't care and it is difficult for them to open their eyes, answer or write anything. Although we are constantly trying to come up with new activities for them and using activation methods, we still do not achieve any results and most of the time they just give us blank paper.

2205	When I saw him climbing on the windowsill, I went to him. Although he was already standing on the windowsill at the time, he was not much taller than me. Several times I told him clearly and loudly to go down. He didn't react to it, but it was quite common for him to have to repeat one piece of information to him several times.

397	The kids worked and at the end they also liked the Lego Marvel video in Russian. The hour went well, except for a few details, see below. Although, as a result, I appreciate that I entered the field so quickly, I also see a shortcoming in the fact that I was not so in the picture in terms of students' knowledge. You can't catch what he can do so quickly, but it might be difficult in three or four weeks.

2582	Although it uses more traditional (sometimes outdated) methods, I have been convinced of their effectiveness and I definitely do not intend to condemn them in my teaching practice. On the other hand, she was very willing to listen to my opinions and she herself asked me what I would recommend to her from more modern approaches.

6295	I didn't deal with the accompanying teacher. I just gave them the notes at the beginning. Although the students reacted a bit more, I didn't enjoy the lesson at all. It was probably the worst lesson I've ever taught. I kept watching the clock, hoping it would ring. Suddenly, those 45 minutes were an incredibly long time.	Although the students reacted a bit more, I didn't enjoy the lesson at all.	Feeling	[5, 5]
1638	The kids found it ridiculous because they don't do it in class. I don't know why, but every time I go to the piano, a discussion starts. Moving the place will wake the children. But despite the discussion, I explained the exercises to them and they repeated them. Great. Then I taught them the songs AniÄka duÅ¡iÄka and ÄÃ­ so hode.	Moving the place will wake the children.

3564	This is another knowledge I take from my Ifka lessons. She convinced me that it is not a shame for a teacher not to know everything, and that it is actually normal to look up a word in an online dictionary in class. This also applies to situations in which the student formulated an idea that I did not understand, because he literally translated the Czech sentence into English, used the wrong word, or the sentence was grammatically wrong.

6542	I watched the teacher deal with them, teach. Frontal teaching again prevailed, but I only attended grammar lessons, in style or literature it might look different. I was surprised that the students were disciplined, careful, if they disturbed, they were immediately reprimanded. I also regularly went to the supervisions that belonged to the accompanying historian.

1792	It also depended on how we and the students enjoyed the lesson. After the first lesson, I received feedback from the teacher. Pros and cons predominated. I was blamed for speaking very monotonously. Sometimes I couldn't come up with the right word, but I was always able to play it somehow.	Pros and cons predominated.	Other	[6, 6]
199	I myself sometimes have a problem with switching languages ââduring my university studies. During the first days of my practice, I found out that a similar problem bothers students. These are mostly complications in teaching German, where students very often enter English words. After all, they have more experience with English and I think it is a priority for them. Another very important point for me was what to expect from the students.	These are mostly complications in teaching German, where students very often enter English words.	Difficulty	[5, 3]

I admit that I remembered almost nothing of it, how much there was!	I read the recommendations on how to work with individual students.	Experience	[5, 4]
473	During the next lesson, she had a half-hour monologue, but she devoted the final 15 minutes to a task for students, which consisted of observing the painting of the Lady of Avignon by Picasso to observe how the painting affects them, whether they are pleasant, like, dislike, etc. and write a short text about it. So I wonder if there will be any activities for students in the next lessons.

729	During art lessons, as in previous internships, I had a problem with the teacher's excessive intervention in teaching. I tried to at least partially reverse the classic case where a teacher brings a model of future creations of students to the class. Students were to imprint the colors with sponges.

2972	It struck me that she didn't even explain to the students what topic to draw. She just said they would draw chess and that was it. No motivation. Maybe that's why the students don't like it. During class, I sometimes walked among the children to see how they were doing. When the teacher noticed me, she came to ask me what I thought about it and if I had any ideas or comments.

4703	They were bolder than usual. However, the test was eventually written. However, while correcting it, I noticed that the three pairs of students sitting on the desk together wrote to the same group and had the same mistakes there.

1068	As I entered the classroom, I felt again insecure, as in every science class. But never mind, I did it quite calmly. She took a breath and the class began. During the quiz over the kahoot, everyone had an incredible fun and tried, until it surprised me that they liked it so much. Then followed the suitcase - I was more worried that I would hear how embarrassing it was and no one would want to do it.

4166	Is there a problem with the teacher's personality - role model, or does it relate to the teacher's private life and has the right to publish anything in any way? They approach music education with great resistance.	In my classes, I would like to improve the enthusiasm of students, if possible.	Intention	[4, 6]

4856	The children were then unable to enter the fields, which were supposed to be twice as large, and due to the poor print quality, they often did not even read the assignment.

5975	Testing is also beneficial for the rest of the class because students also get involved. They are used to asking classmates questions at the blackboard, so they repeat the subject as well. When repeating, children throw a ball around the class, learn to formulate a question and are ready to answer questions. They work with the textbook every hour. They read the text, the teacher explains it to them, trying to understand what is written in the textbook. He tells them a lot of interesting things, uses presentations, videos.

5812	The weight fraction and its methods of calculation were discussed. They recalled two already known procedures. One using a triplet and the other using a formula. However, all students used a triple element for the calculation. When counting three examples, the teacher pointed out the common mistakes and then the students counted independently. When the teacher argued, she acknowledged the mistake and corrected herself. I liked that. None of the students had stupid remarks. Everyone respected each other and no one interrupted.

1979	They're just used to being part of a class, but I'd say I don't have much authority over them. That's why I was pretty nervous before learning in this class.

However, the agreement of the practice turned out without any problems, so I boarded.

However, when I entered the classroom, something was waiting for me that I was definitely not expecting - the little pimp started cheering that I would teach them again, and the teacher told me that they were looking forward to me and that they were still pulling out in front of the second group. straight two.

5275	In the workshops, it occurs to me that the work is more individual, always about checking the correct procedure and adhering to work safety. It strikes me as strange that there were only 16 desks in the workshop, while there are 20 pupils in the class. It is a pity that an hour of work activities lasts only one lesson.

1633	The teacher sent me lesson plans. Now the ninth graders have begun to discuss a new subject - calculations from chemical equations. After the introductory lesson, the teacher prepared worksheets for them for the next lesson. It occurs to me that the hour will pass quickly and there won't be much time.

I felt like I was going to school as a new student and not as an intern. The present teaching assistant also remarked that not only the children but also herself are afraid in my accompanying teacher's lessons.

2305	It would be an invaluable experience, but I would not want to experience something like this in front of someone else and not an experienced teacher at all. I would feel terribly stupid to be incompetent. I know that such things just happen and, as I was convinced, to experienced teachers, but I would have a big problem inside. I'm just like that.	I would feel terribly stupid to be incompetent.	Feeling	[6, 5]
4019	Almost every time I asked something, he reported, but the look on his face was still the same. He seemed so annoyed that he didn't like it much, that the hour bothered him, it seemed to me that his face was crooked, sad, in fact, I couldn't even describe his expression properly. I called the student to the board several times, each time having the same expression. I think about what it is. . .

Reflection	[4, 5]
3724	I definitely think that there was something to talk about and appreciate in connection with the pictures. Which is actually something I wanted to elaborate on more. It seemed to me that the teacher warned the children too much about the shortcomings, and on the contrary, she did not comment at all on the successful work. Maybe because in these cases she had nothing to complain about the students. Although I don't think the quality of the images is any different.

6	Also, it is no longer possible to sing with pupils in the 8th and 9th grades at all, and that is why he does not practice it at all in class, in the 6th. with extended music education. This accompanying teacher arranged arrangements for me in the classes of other music teachers. That probably got me a little positive in the end.	It seems to me like a special attitude of a teacher who teaches in elementary school with widespread music education.	Reflection	[4, 3]
3548	They didn't ignore me anymore, they even started greeting me at the rat. I even felt that as they walked past me, they seemed to calm down and get out of my way. I find it interesting that I didn't even need to talk to them or reprimand them for something, they just did it so automatically. It was quite similar in class today, I also noticed a change in the ninth graders, whom I thought I would definitely not teach there.

6520	Did they do anything to help them with the test or oral examination by the teacher? It has its pros and cons, like everything around us. So let's start with the disadvantages. It seems to me that sometimes we can really slow down in such activities with younger (but also older) students in such a way that almost nothing in a given lesson can be discussed in a given lesson (as was probably the case in the lesson in my introductory description).

6704	But it was the first hour and the children were still sleeping there. At least some. I'm starting to hate this class, although there are very good students among them. I just like I hate technology. The connection to the computer is somewhat distorted, and when I connect the projector to a PC, the screen on my PC starts to turn off. Okay, I thought. I can do it without a presentation. So began the interpretation. I tried to make contact with the students, I went around the class, I asked them.

3546	I liked this kind of motivation because all the students worked for the rest of the lesson and no one was disturbing. The weight fraction and its methods of calculation were discussed. They recalled two already known procedures. One using a triplet and the other using a formula. However, all students used a triple element for the calculation.	They recalled two already known procedures.	Other	[6, 6]
6445	In practice, I always feel at home. It reminds me of how good I felt as a student in elementary school. I will learn or experience something new at every other internship.

6638	The teacher returns to the classroom and the class slowly ends. The students are smiling and wishing me a pleasant weekend. I feel good, very good. It reminds me that I've always wanted this. I wanted a job that would fulfill me, a job where I wouldn't know it was a job, but mainly a hobby. Could that be it? Did I make a good choice?	It reminds me that I've always wanted this.

1387	In retrospect, I think that maybe if I were stricter on those sevens, they would appreciate it more, because they were really wild. Or if it was the subject matter? I was ready to go, but if I didn't motivate them much? It would be interesting to try them again. Overall, I am very curious what the sevenths will be like in the next internship. Unless, for example, it was due to age.	I was ready to go, but did I motivate them a little?	Reflection	[1, 5]
3997	We had literature on Friday. I prepared two alternatives. Conversations with TG Masaryk by Karel Äapek and The War with Newts by the same author.	I prepared two alternatives.	Experience	[4, 5]
6363	So my first feelings from this lesson were feelings of success and a job well done. However, a different situation occurred in a literature class (second year of high school). I prepared for the students various poems from the work of J. Neruda and first they should interpret the individual poems, secondly the method of comparison to look for what is different and thirdly analyze the typical elements of Neruda's workNerudy and firstly interpret the individual poems, secondly the method of comparison, how they differ and thirdly to analyze the typical elements of Neruda's work.

6474	The teacher advised me to try to prepare a lesson in action and activity, that athletes do not enjoy history, but action. So I prepared a lot of songs and developed a sophisticated body play for each one. I divided them into several groups and each did something different. They were really intrigued, they tried to meet my requirements, even if it was difficult for them.	So I prepared a lot of songs and developed a sophisticated body play for each one.	Experience	[6, 4]
3280	Teaching in tandem with my accompanying teacher was also an excellent experience for me. We prepared an hour of healthy nutrition, where we each had a couple of specially prepared activities, and in the second part of the hour we tried to do an hour in tandem. I was a helper here, asking students for advice on lifestyle and an adequate diet.

1497	I was surprised at the rumble at school. What I saw, but did not find out, the teacher did not have any free hours. She had been teaching since morning. I'll see how I can learn.

The teacher offered me to poke and introduced me to the students after coming to class.	We are preparing for laboratory work.	Experience	[2, 3]
5327	It's useless because they keep the whole class from moving forward. Geography is easier for them, as it is in Czech and children can respond more quickly to questions, etc. I prepare various quizzes and competitions for them every other hour, which are evaluated with stamps or mini marks for the activity. An hour is more enjoyable when you don't have to just sit and write. So far, I evaluate everything really positively.

5154	At least I think so. The history is talkative, we have a lot of historical films that introduce students to the subject. The citizen is lifeless in this respect. At the same time, I would say that it is more important for the child's future than history. Why is that so? Why is it only available for one hour a week, while other subjects are taught more often?

892	The question is, do you use this method in mathematics? Before I led the lesson myself, I felt nervous and nervous. At the same time, I was ready and had worksheets ready for the students. We were just repeating prisms (cube and block). I also realized that it is better to have the preparation prepared on one sheet of paper.

2777	My initial joy at the positive contact waned, and the rest of the practice I had to drive him away and tell him to go alone and ignore him. At the same time, I didn't even mind going around the game room with him in various ways, but of course the teacher knows better than I do what is best. Plus, she told me in a tone that made me know it was clear.

1431	Here I discovered a subtle flaw, namely that on the dark blue map it was difficult to see the black arrows with the names of the composers, which were directed to the individual countries. At the same time, everything was clearly visible on the computer, but it was merged by projection on a screen. From this follows the lesson that one gains much experience only from practice.

3757	I went through the class myself. In children with dysgraphia, it is almost often impossible for them to transcribe whole words without error. At the same time, it is one of the important things in language - to be able not only to say words, but also to write correctly according to me. I also had the opportunity to correct my homework - a copy of 8 incomplete sentences, where it was necessary to add one word from the text.

888	"The mentioned art teacher, who is also widely employed in primary school, has become my ""substitute"" accompanying teacher. I admit that I was worried about this, because her teacher does not look very tidy, the teacher gives the impression that she does not have them under control, that she is confused, nervous and scattered.

151	Of course, the number of teachers corresponds to this number of pupils. I admit that this fact does not suit me - I prefer a greater anonymity of a larger school, where others do not look at it as an apparition when it first appears there (and perhaps another 14 days later). I know it's maybe a little weird, but it wasn't pleasant to feel the look of those teenagers all the time. Now as for the practice itself.

However, finding words was not a problem. So we quickly repeated the grammatical categories we determine for nouns.

4992	I liked that it was not a plain interpretation and the children just didn't listen to the teacher. On the other hand, the lesson was busy and the teacher was constantly admonishing someone. It seemed pretty crazy to me when she once said five words to interpret, reprimanded someone, three words from interpretation, and reprimanded someone again. I would evaluate the work in class, ideally for small marks, and one of them would be large. The child would stop having fun collecting fives for constant distractions.

2795	During the teacher's speech, the children reported or called them up on their own. The students answered very gladly. It seemed to me as if one was vying over who would be able to say the right answer. The children in this class are narrators and like to discuss. But far from just about the curriculum.

4020	The big surprise for me was the appearance of the classes. Personally, I have not yet met the classes in which everyone has their own desk. It occurred to me that even though the children are close to each other, they are far apart.

4632	The children's works from the lessons taught by this teacher hung in the corridors. It occurred to me that they are relatively good. This week of practice, I realized why the quality is so good.

5900	And I don't think it's a pity that any teacher can teach and involve students, even if there's no complete silence. It occurred to me that in science lessons, they are much more accessible and open to communication, thanks to this more benevolent approach to complete silence in the classroom. They are not afraid to express themselves, they ask, they get involved. It occurred to me that there was a more partnership approach, and therefore more openness. Pupils take the teacher.

He found it very funny, but the class (with the exception of one student, who must have at least LMR, but he doesn't have the papers for it) didn't like it and they started shouting at him.

620	Respect each other and especially smile. I like to make fun at class. Present a two-tone song as very difficult and watch who notices it. Excessive pursuit of professionalism is not very bearable for children. In practice, I had the opportunity to meet a teacher who was brimming with this effort. No student liked him. You played the teacher. He forgot that children are creatures and need a smile.	Excessive pursuit of professionalism is not very bearable for children.	Belief	[5, 5]
4995	What I had a little problem with was eye contact. Sometimes I didn't know if the students were nervous about my direct eye contact. Direct eye contact also deepened my morning fatigue, and I must admit that in some situations I was just looking at a student and I don't even know what he was saying (I was looking stupid, I hope the student didn't ask me something). There were other little things I didn't even realize before. While the student was watching the TedTalk video, I straightened up the papers from the previous activity.

686	Thanks to that, I already have a bit of a comparison of how to prepare an hour for six-year-olds, who are lively, noisy, but have fun on the topic and are interested in it. The preparation and the course of the lesson are therefore diametrically different from the course in the 9th grade, where, on the contrary, the activity is zero and I have to make a great effort to motivate the pupils and push them to some activity. class, where, on the contrary, the activity is zero and I have to make a great effort to motivate the pupils and push them to some activity.

5219	Children do not have much of a connection to language and they do not enjoy the lessons very much, so I try to invent and look for activities to work at least a little.

4644	I hope to collect more situations in the next reflective diary and to be able to write it down. How do I feel about my own lessons? So they start from the beginning.

Preparing for lessons was very difficult for me.	Difficulty	[5, 6]
2986	At this school, they learn according to the textbook Vite 1 and 2. I really don't understand how they could have chosen it as the most suitable. Neither me nor the teacher suits me at all. Preparing for lessons takes about three times as long when you want to teach according to a textbook than when you create your own activity from the beginning. Or at least the ratio was like when I was getting ready for class. The first one I taught was mainly about phonetics and pronunciation and I didn't work with the textbook at all.

6951	I agreed to teach the Bronze Age in 6th grade. I quite enjoyed prehistory, and I really liked the theme of the Bronze Age. I took the preparation very carefully and spent about four hours in total, which is a lot of time and I hope that I will gradually work out and manage the preparations faster, because I would not be able to do anything with such a high and at the same time assistant work. I designed the lesson so that the students were as active as possible. The explanation was supplemented by pictures, video and maps.

4953	So I agreed with the teacher on which day, which class and also on the content of the curriculum. I prepared the preparation in advance at home and sent it to the teacher by e-mail so that she would have a little idea of ââthe direction my teaching would take. I was grateful that she hadn't come with me for an hour, but stayed in the office doing some work.

2946	I had several hours in both subjects. For example, I will present only selected of them. Geography: In geography, I was given the task to work on the topic of the Atlantic Ocean for the 7th year. I did the preparation honestly and it took me about 2.5 hours. After the students, we had a few questions for the introduction to practice, as well as to decipher the topic of the lesson by our own reasoning.	I did the preparation honestly and it took me about 2.5 hours.	Experience	[5, 3]
535	I don't want that again, even though a lot of teachers have been teaching like this for so many years. On Tuesday, we will round off the decimal numbers. I'm ready to prepare, so I'm curious how it will turn out. So far, I have a problem estimating how much students will manage and how they will do. Although rounding decimal numbers seems extremely easy to me.	I'm ready to prepare, so I'm curious how it will turn out.	Feeling	[3, 3]

6134	The accompanying teacher gave me valuable feedback right after the lesson and suggested that I be able to teach a lesson with the same topic in a parallel class of the 7th grade. We slightly adjusted the preparation for this lesson according to their advice. The second class lesson was completely different. The students cooperated very nicely, they were disciplined, very sharp and the lesson had a completely different charge.

5563	I really like the approach of my accompanying teacher, who consults with me on preparations for the lesson, easily by e-mail or text message. Preparations are usually our joint work, we always divide the tasks in advance (for example, the teacher compiles a glossary of terms for students on the topic of the legal minimum Â® I will create a worksheet where children practice everything).

2304	The second lesson in class 6. And I was in charge. I was supposed to come up with examples to practice the curriculum. My impressions of this lesson were mixed. I spent a lot of time preparing.

586	"A. and then in 7. B. The first mentioned class, which pays for the ""worse"" one at school, really did appear on this day. All the students who are known as the biggest disturbers and who can take away the part of the class that would like to concentrate were present.

4217	The students cooperated very nicely, they were disciplined, very sharp and the lesson had a completely different charge. But I think the situation in the first grade would be different if I was alone in teaching. The presence of the accompanying teacher made me slightly uncertain, and my demeanor was not entirely natural and not as authoritative as it could be. Next time I will try to ask the accompanying teacher to be alone with the class. We are curious about the result. History: I also learned several hours in history.

450	Only an absolute fool thinks to light a fire in front of the school in the sixth grade when the teacher goes to work. At the beginning of the lesson we deal with their behavior. Fifteen minutes from the hour in wonder. I'm furious. He'll write a disgusting paper the next hour, but he doesn't know it yet. I'll let them bully new colleagues.

2182	Otherwise, nothing special really happened. What would interest me. It was repeated on quarterly papers and the next week the students wrote them. Next semester I would like to go to more literature, if the schedule allows it. Now I almost always took Czech language lessons. Anyway, at that school, everything feels faster than I thought.

5890	As the teacher ran from building to building, he arrived within the lesson with a slight delay. Pupils have already prepared unfinished drawings themselves and started painting. Next week I will have a comparison with another class of freshmen, but this one surprised me how responsible they are. After my performance, we moved to the next classroom of art history, where one of the students prepared a presentation. They are free to choose a topic.	Next week I will have a comparison with another class of freshmen, but this one surprised me how responsible they are.	Feeling	[4]
978	It is even more difficult then to motivate students when you have them in class 33. This is almost unrealistic, I would say.

3516	Next week I will have independent learning in all classes, so I wonder if I will be able to discuss at least for the most part the planned curriculum in all classes, if students will communicate with me without any problems and if there will be a good atmosphere in the classrooms.

2733	I consider this to be very good, the students were not so afraid and there was a more relaxed atmosphere between us and the overall communication was easier. I was originally supposed to teach the second lesson of VV, but my accompanying teacher stayed in the column, so I was commissioned to teach the first lesson. It was also the seventh grade I knew from the previous week. I had training, so I wasn't too surprised and went to study for an hour.

265	My expectations sometimes differ from reality. I spent a lot of time with the fifth grade (4 weeks of listening). They react to me, I think, well, they are communicative, they ask me for my opinion, etc. Nevertheless, when I led the lesson alone, the atmosphere in the classroom was different from when it was led by an accompanying teacher.	They react to me, I think, well, they are communicative, they ask me for my opinion, etc.	Reflection	[5, 5]
3165	At the end of the class, we sat in the office and appreciated the lesson. The reaction was positive and I was happy.

The reaction was positive and I was happy.	Feeling	[6, 6]
4473	Since my compulsory primary schooling, I have kept in mind that in primary school, two hours of science are taught each year in primary school.

But the reality is, at least at the school where I practice, different.	Reflection	[3, 3]
6438	In the meantime, I completed my bachelor's degree and was accepted into a follow-up master's degree. I was hoping for a change in approach, from an overly theoretical approach to study to a practical approach.

961	I'm sorry we didn't make it to the final secret, which I had ready to repeat. Respectively, we caught up with half. But time was not enough for me even in the second hour.

5830	So I had very positive experiences with the first internship, I liked working there with the pupils, everyone treated me very kindly and politely. They followed my instructions.

557	Well, I'll try another hour. I don't want to be the terrible teacher who forces children to sit in the strictly arranged arrangement of benches established during Austria.

810	From the next hour, I prepared a small test in stock, if necessary. And it was. So when it was not possible to direct the class, I gave them the test. The test was not famous at all. So I decided not to mark him, only to give plus and minus for him (in the class there is a system that for 5 plus there is one, for 5 minus five). But instead of the children being happy and trying to behave better for another hour, everything was almost the same. So I should have given them fives?

5750	Children often have bad grades in class, in my opinion due to its high demands on the curriculum. The children had zero relationship to their class (room). So I decided to teach an art class with a social media theme in this class and post these creations to help them build the relationship they needed. While teaching 8th grade, I found myself in a situation where students had inappropriate notes with a sexual undertone. I would probably need to figure out a way to deal with these students.	So I decided to teach an art class with a social media theme in this class and post these creations to help them build the relationship they needed.	Experience	[5, 2]
5146	However, I appreciate that he often connects matter with everyday life. Somehow it bothers me now that I know how I wouldn't want to do it, but how it would actually. I would definitely try to maintain the structure of the lesson and not run away from the topic according to what comes to my mind. to the mind. I think it confuses even the children themselves, when they don't pay attention for a while and suddenly they talk about something completely different.	I would definitely try to maintain the structure of the lesson and not run away from the topic according to what comes to my mind.	Reflection	[4, 4]
4884	The teacher is very accommodating and is definitely a natural authority. I really liked the way she taught her, especially the way she communicates with the students for the whole lesson. It is definitely possible to see that the pupils respect her and love her. They are not afraid to solve some situations with a joke and the pupils enjoy it. When I was preparing for my own teaching, I tried not to forget anything.	It is definitely possible to see that the pupils respect her and love her.	Other	[6, 4]
2303	I still have some reservations here and there (for example, in terms of the capacity to remember flocks of children), but basically I don't rate badly. It is definitely good that I went to listen to history, because literature was much easier for me to connect with. And I taught mostly here. I didn't really deal much with grammar, the main exception was a word stress / sentence melody.	It is definitely good that I went to listen to history, because literature was much easier for me to connect with.	Reflection	[4, 5]
726	Last but not least, I perceive how easy it is to make favorites among students. I definitely didn't want to be inclined to do so and I try not to admit this, because I want to treat students just as fairly. However, the pupils are more diligent, the pupils are lazier, the pupils are nicer and the pupils are more annoying, and with emotions and sympathies one does not do much.	I definitely didn't want to be inclined to do so and I try not to admit this, because I want to treat students just as fairly.	Experience	[5, 3]
1321	But then there were other topics, especially the creation of the lesson plan. I never planned a thorough plan. A few points at most, according to which I wanted to drive the lesson. I definitely didn't spend over an hour planning, like my classmates throwing unrealistic numbers. Another task was to arrange the lesson in an exemplary way according to what it should look like.	I definitely didn't spend over an hour planning, like my classmates throwing unrealistic numbers.	Experience	[4, 3]
2523	I'm quite taken aback and sad because I always thought that my teaching personality could be my strong point. I definitely don't want to do anything that won't make me feel good, but on the other hand I want the students to really learn something. Is it really not possible without fear, rigor and punishment? My practice continues at the grammar school in Blansko. I still have hours in the second, fourth and first year.	I definitely don't want to do anything that won't make me feel good, but on the other hand I want the students to really learn something.	Reflection	[4, 6]
4793	I commented on many, I was happy when the children listened to me, sometimes even took my advice. I definitely think that there was something to talk about and appreciate in connection with the pictures. Which is actually something I wanted to elaborate on more. It seemed to me that the teacher warned the children too much about the shortcomings, and on the contrary, she did not comment at all on the successful work.	I definitely think that there was something to talk about and appreciate in connection with the pictures.	Reflection	[4, 5]
1301	I wanted to get a picture of the teacher myself. 6th grade - computer science Right in the first lesson I had the feeling that the teacher has everything firmly in his hands. But it certainly didn't look as serious as everyone described to me. The teacher led the class a little harder but it would not happen that he would raise his voice unnecessarily.	But it certainly didn't look as serious as everyone described to me.	Experience	[2, 3]
955	I've heard enough about this class in that month. Especially because my accompanying teacher in Czech is their class. It's definitely not the worst class at school, neither in terms of grades nor in terms of behavior. But they are also not among the better. They are still at an age when puberty has the main say and have no problem ignoring teachers.	It's definitely not the worst class at school, neither in terms of grades nor in terms of behavior.

3029	On the contrary, it happened to me that we finished the class in the middle of some activity, and then it made no sense at all. It definitely follows for me that I have to watch my time more and plan my lesson better. For example, include the activity at the beginning of the hour after the recurrence to catch the whole thing. Otherwise, the students were quite willing to engage in activities and communicate with me.	It definitely follows for me that I have to watch my time more and plan my lesson better.	Intention	[6, 3]
803	At the beginning of the year, when math is every day, he teaches the same subject for three hours.

4646	Disruptive, but I can't blame him. I kept coming back to how he repeated and commented on everything I said. I thought I'd try to call him out more often next time and give him a chance to talk.

307	Overall, he was willing to show me anything and explain what works for them.

My hands are tied by a technique that there is none, and I find that I am not at all able and ready to work without a data projector, because I experienced it at elementary school as a student.

The Russian language is the second optional language in HorÃ¡ckÃ½, so the working groups are relatively small (about 10 pupils) and composed of several classes (ABC), which I perceive as very beneficial, as not so much is shown. My accompanying teacher is a terrible sympathizer from the point of view and she has a calm motherly impression and she still treats the students.

5075	I can judge that Geography caught my heart more, because it is clear that students also enjoy more than the Russian language. Russian is difficult for me due to the fact that not every student has the same level in a given year. I also have such experts there who can't, for example; in the 8th grade still writing in Cyrillic. So how do you want to work with them?

6319	In some situations, teachers are powerless and have relatively few resources to achieve what they need.

4037	What do we have kindergartens from? Why are there suddenly mixed-age groups in kindergartens that used to systematically prepare preschoolers for the first grade, who inevitably steal time from this preschool, but that change of pupils is only a reflection of something else, probably mainly the attitude of parents who do not have time or simply they do not want to prepare with their children, which I see in my immediate surroundings, the child is important to just entertain something, especially not to be bothered.

3383	Great video by AntonÃ­n Sova on teaching Czech impressionism: https: // www. youtube. com / watch? v = XNCYRzctYv0 In the 9th grade, the way a teacher behaves towards students changes. He communicates with them as equals.	So I wonder why he treats ninth-graders in this way and why not younger ones?	Reflection	[6, 4]

7029	Next plan, at least at the beginning, I plan to discuss this topic again with the students who took part in the strike. Somehow I think that the profession of a teacher will not really be for me. Not that it was bad or I didn't enjoy it, but I can't imagine it as a lifelong profession.

3650	So why do I have such a fast heartbeat? I thought that after the first hour, where I wasn't even nervous, I wouldn't be nervous at all, and I just started to enjoy it. Well, I was wrong.	So why is my heart rate so fast?	Reflection	[5, 4]
2628	After teaching, the teacher came to me with the knowledge that she knew that it was not a very pedagogical procedure, but that it was the only way that affected him. So why not? The problem with behavior is something we encounter and will encounter in the teaching profession today and every day. We can calm the noise, the stories need to be planted.	So why not?	Reflection	[3, 2]
2786	But I can't imagine how I would evaluate this very non-intensive and resigned work. Should I really salt their fives? So I don't like it, can I do it? How could I take this class? I can't imagine teaching in such a class yet. Also, it's just listening, I'm calming down.	So I don't like it, can I do it?	Reflection	[4, 6]
3250	The class is also in a mood and euphoria where one student shouts after another, and if we have larger groups of children, it may be more difficult to keep the class out of unnecessary traffic.	So now I think, is it really wise to get involved?	Reflection	[6, 5]
4562	I'm used to standing in front of the class and teaching, but the feeling of being accompanied by an accompanying teacher is really uncomfortable. So I wonder what the point is, when we still have to plan the hour according to what they want. What's the point of having seen the class once before and now I have to show some art there. But come on, I'll just put it up there and bye.	So I wonder what the point is, when we still have to plan the hour according to what they want.	Reflection	[6, 3]
1208	They really radiate a kind of inner motivation, because they like to learn the language and there is no need to motivate them further. So I say to myself, is it really just this? Do young students really learn English just because they know they will use it in the future? Can he think ahead?	So I guess, is it really just this?	Reflection	[4, 4]
6210	The opposite is true. That's not how I think an assistant's job should look like. It's actually a prime example of how not to do it.

1016	Ok, if it's not good, we'll try bad, I thought. The unexpected marking didn't work out either, Jakub always has everything right, Oliver doesn't care about the marks at all. So homework.

3782	Only one boy kept saying that they were embarrassed that if they wanted to do a pank, they should take his whole bag.

4923	I was sorry for one boy. The poor man was terribly nervous. His paper, as nervous as it was, got stuck and was constantly used, according to the teacher, the so-called padding word. I really enjoyed my hour like this and I ran away terribly. Otherwise, nothing special really happened. What would interest me. It was repeated on quarterly papers and the next week the students wrote them.	I really enjoyed my hour like this and I ran away terribly.	Feeling	[5, 5]
2775	I like e.g. that children are divided into smaller groups into languages, always up to 15 children. But the technique, I'll have to blame them, because I'm dissatisfied. This makes it difficult to work creatively when one simply lacks the technical background. There are no computers there either, teachers have to carry laptops to the classroom. So of course when kids have listening, it's hard to hear because the laptop speaker isn't much.	This makes it difficult to work creatively when one simply lacks the technical background.	Other	[4, 6]

1615	I noticed that one student, later found out with IVP, went to the teacher several times to pass the test, she alerted him to some possible mistakes. He came back like this, I think, about three times. He finally got for 4. The teacher herself was bad for it, because the student is very hardworking. He himself does not want to have bad grades and tries to get good ones.	He came back like this, I think, about three times.	Reflection	[3, 5]
1730	I saw how terribly disappointed they were. This is definitely not how a relationship is formed. It is clear that the teacher is not omnipotent and is not in a position to solve everything, but sometimes it is enough to show that we are trying to solve something, that we are not indifferent.	This is definitely not how a relationship is formed.	Belief	[5, 5]
6727	Not that it wouldn't work for me. I have never been so tired and sweaty after 45 minutes :).

I have never been so tired and sweaty after 45 minutes :).	Feeling	[6, 5]
6418	Sometimes one of them turned on me in the bench and smiled at me. Such gestures began to reassure me. I feel that I am no longer as scared of them as I was from the beginning.

5456	It was such the beginning of everything, when I didn't know how to react to it at all, and somehow I slowly went over it and probably tried not to notice.

2865	It can be seen that the students are used to a faster pace. I think this is also the case because the teacher does not have to deal with disciplinary problems so often in class.

I must also mention the enthusiasm of the students.	Other	[5, 6]
4676	I want to tell them that the sun is really shining here. Is it like parents at home did not learn decent behavior? The teacher should primarily teach them, not educate them.

I also didn't like discipline.	Feeling	[6, 3]
1969	The role of the school assistant is a mystery to me in some classes. Is her job writing SMS to parents about the course of teaching? Why else would she spend an entire hour on the phone? In one lesson I took on the role of an assistant myself, working independently with a 9th grade boy who needs a little more time to complete tasks.	It also seems to me that those who are active in the classroom are mainly there to lift all the students' writing supplies, or to show where we are in the text.	Reflection	[2, 4]

2990	This makes it difficult to work creatively when one simply lacks the technical background. There are no computers there either, teachers have to carry laptops to the classroom. So of course when kids have listening, it's hard to hear because the laptop speaker isn't much. Summary: technically, the last school was better and it was really a luxury.

3918	That's probably the most satisfying thing about it. You saw it in the last episode. . . No, this is not an ideal start, but I want to build on the previous entry. There I reflected on the formality and report in general between the pupil-teacher relationship and compared the experience of teaching adults with the experience of teaching in primary and secondary school.

Techniques for calming the audience by changing the volume are among his favorites. The most interesting, however, is his sarcastic humor, which he likes to use in class.

2345	I myself have no idea how I will ever be able to teach. Maybe I didn't believe in languages ââthat the students would ask me a lot of words that I wouldn't know, etc. But now I've found that I can speak German the best I can, but when there's such an unbelievable mess in class, I can't teach them anything at all.

1811	Well, I fixed it, but I didn't dare mark it for one simple reason. I would give everyone a storm. It was such a tragedy that I brought it to my accompanying teacher, who looked at it (I divided the tests into three categories: usable, scary, and maybe you don't mean that) and stated that we can't give everyone five. So she looked at the first class, who had 23 points out of 37 (!!!) and gave her 1-, then she looked at the names rather than the overall score.

492	I also see the progress they are making. In my opinion, this is one of the things that gives teachers the most strength to stay in their profession and to keep them entertained by this difficult work. At the same time, I also like the fact that we have already created a pleasant climate together in Czech language lessons, so students are not afraid to release their ideas into the world.

3423	All the more then, I don't understand what's going on and where it's going. It is even more difficult then to motivate students when you have them in class 33. This is almost unrealistic, I would say. Next week I will have my own teaching in this class, so I will be wiser. I don't feel good teaching in such a big classroom.	That's almost unrealistic, I'd say.	Difficulty	[5, 1]
913	Or I can think of the book The Most Colorful Cookbook by Kam. At the opening of the book, it is as if we have entered a completely different world, a world of wonders, scents and the unseen art of gastronomy. This is what fascinates students, the unbridled power of gastronomy. If I also looked at other professional subjects such as raw materials and tableware, I would certainly find a lot of new publications that are pleasantly refreshing and not long and tiring.

1614	So they have to write this way. Another solution would be to leave the statements to the students to write down what they find important. However, this is quite difficult for pupils aged 10-14.

However, this is quite difficult for pupils aged 10-14.	Belief	[4, 4]
4635	I felt the determination, I felt the energy. I just hope that I will not be more tired next time, because when a person sleeps well, he has more control over everything. That is today's finding.

5498	I think that using a series that children know has led to great success. Then I tried to make the children think critically by constantly asking questions.

I didn't solve that, before he always did everything he had, and even during the inspection he wrote down the key answers, I said to myself that if he didn't realize that he couldn't lie like that, I would salt him a little for a while. Another was a pair of girls who do not know how much fun they had on the topic, but even here it was true that there were two who always do what they have to do.

After all, I discussed this even after an hour with the professor if I didn't really dig into one - but as I correctly guessed, she also confirmed it to me, he is the type who will definitely not be harmed and will not take it personally.

I told myself that maybe after a while I wouldn't be a stranger to her anymore. I will not be strangers. (By the way, this was confirmed to me in the third week of the internship, the little girl started asking me some things herself.	I respected that.

4683	In the end, they prefer to work independently. Nothing special will happen by the end of the hour. Another hour. Sixth grade again, but this time 6th grade. The class is even more unruly. Is that what I found in a lion's den? The children shout at the teacher. They do not want to be divided into groups, so half of the class works independently. I tell myself that the team here will probably not be very friendly.	Did I find myself in a lion's den?	Reflection	[6, 5]
1724	The supervisions took place in peace, no special situations occurred, and on the contrary, I was pleasantly surprised when the students obeyed after the first reprimand. They also made me happy by greeting them. I honestly didn't expect that much, because I didn't even see some of them in class. Overall, the time spent at this elementary school did not deter me from my future profession and I am glad that I also looked at the city school.

5110	This teacher likes to teach animals, humans, plants do not make her a problem, much less she likes to teach genetics and rubble.

5469	Then the principal told me that the vast majority of today's children do not have a chance to understand it and from his many years of experience he knows that this was a very useful knowledge for me, to be able to adapt the curriculum to the level of students, but again the question: to? 9th grade, I went without any expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

6345	It disturbed me quite a bit, because then I didn't hear what others were saying. It occurred to me that he probably wanted the floor. But when I offered it to him, he didn't want to talk. That seemed strange to me. Even after repeated reprimands, he did not close his mouth. The other students also reprimanded him - most of the class was actively involved in teaching, which I enjoyed immensely.	That seemed strange to me.	Feeling	[3, 3]
4513	"I then had to finish the two-hour class in order to clean up, but the children would continue to work. One student even stated during the lesson that ""he will remember this for the rest of his life."" I recharged my pedagogical flashlight!

That recharged my pedagogical flashlight again!	Other	[5, 5]
6103	The presentation was nicely structured, supplemented by three videos related to the chosen topic. The students listened to their classmate and watched. I forgot to mention, this is the 3rd year of a 4-year grammar school. This also reassured me, and I thought it would keep my attention during my presentation today. Fortunately, relatively decent discipline prevailed even during my interpretation. At the beginning, I chose an emotional map with the theme - what comes to mind when you say soil.	This also reassured me, and I thought it would keep my attention during my presentation today.	Feeling	[3, 4]
3030	It doesn't mean she's the teacher and they're the students, but she's in high school and they want her. That sounded great to me. I wondered how I could stand in front of a full class of boys who are a head taller than me and are in their twenties.	That sounded great to me.	Feeling	[4, 6]
1767	"When I said goodbye to the students, they said that it was a pity that it was a lot of fun and that I should come again.

1941	He gave me some tips on how to lead the lesson, but praised me for the selected examples. It motivated and inspired me and I thought it might not be so stupid.

It motivated and inspired me and I thought it might not be so stupid.	Experience	[3, 4]
140	But the logical explanation did not help in most cases. This surprised me a little, because I expected everyone to want to do something fun, like games. If it's not good, it's bad, I thought. So the next thing that came to my mind was the threat of a test.	This surprised me a little, because I expected everyone to want to do something fun, like games.	Feeling	[5, 4]
905	"Immediately after I entered the classroom and told the students that I would teach instead of the teacher, the first desks said, ""Oh,"". That made me a little nervous at first.

That made me a little nervous at first.	Feeling	[6, 4]
2227	Because, at least I think it's for this reason, with children who teach chemistry, every day in math class, he has silence in the classroom. This surprised me a lot, because I expected the students to be more unruly. Teaching is currently taking place in groups, frontally. The children work with the teacher, they are not afraid to go to the blackboard.	This surprised me a lot, because I expected the students to be more unruly.	Feeling	[5, 4]
6049	Maybe it was so obvious from my behavior that I was applauded for it. This led me to the idea that not only athletes in music education, but all students in all subjects must be taken as they are. We must not think that our subject is the most amazing and important at school. All students must have the worst two, or it will be bad.

As clearly, we are all just people, but where is the limit when we still teach the best we can and when we make some concessions?

This brings me to the idea of ââunder what circumstances a teacher can teach well and when a physical or mental condition already has an effect on him. As clearly, we are all just people, but where is the limit when we still teach the best we can and when we make some concessions?

389	But in the end, I think most of them had a lot of fun. Another thing I came across was the press. It is already a lot to print one page for each student. This surprised me a little, mainly because the teacher told me at the first meeting that it was not a problem to print anything. Well, it's not. When it's not enough.

This could be due to a time pressure, because the teacher gave the last ten minutes of enrollment without any explanation. Maybe I would make this more efficient and send the minutes directly to the children by e-mail and spend the ten minutes discussing again. Another problem was the presentations.

1462	With the leaf form, I found that I pay more attention to the class and try to listen to what activity is right. This detachment from the precisely prescribed schedule helped me to relax more in class and talk calmly and more confidently.

2589	I had to improvise because the interactive whiteboard didn't work. I solved it by the children walking and writing on a classic blackboard with a marker. This solution was spontaneous and I think on my part in place. Furthermore, at the beginning I handed out questionnaires to the children of one former student without knowing the detailed content.	This solution was spontaneous and I think on my part in place.	Reflection	[5, 3]
5104	I looked at the teacher and wondered what I would instinctively do? I would probably raise my voice to draw attention to myself and shout at the children. This solution is certainly not good, but I think that in the position of a teacher I would react like this. This lesson was very stimulating for me, I was aware of the complexity of the teaching profession and the big difference between teaching students in the first grade and in the second.

This activity can also brighten up the lesson.

6819	This task should be for 2 max 3 teaching hours, but in the future it didn't look like that. I was a little disappointed and started thinking about starting points.

I am a little annoyed by the approach of the teacher, who asked me one single question before each lesson, and that is whether I know everything.

6185	There are four classes in a square in each cell, so the teacher does not go too far and from one place he has practically an overview of all classes.

6124	"In ""unattended"" classes, the children love to communicate with me and how many times we talk about the topic of the lesson (even outside it) so that the lesson runs away with incredible speed. So I was a little worried that if their teacher was present at the class as a supervisor, so as not to disturb the atmosphere in the classroom and instead of active children, I would not have a class of silent ""corpses"".

6654	Well, to my surprise, something happened the next day that I didn't even expect - the teacher told me that next week I would lead the OV class at 9 B alone. I was a little surprised and asked how it was that sudden change and she just told me that the ninth graders were absolutely excited about me and were very happy and I wanted me to teach them as soon as possible.

3301	We even talked about it in the office, and that's how all the teachers there perceive it. The main problem is all dys-specific disorders and their impact on the student. I do not want to alleviate the problems of the pupils concerned, but instead of working and training more, they get a paper that they do not have to learn a lot (for example, in English it is enough to learn to write words as they read). How is it possible that every second student now suffers from some SP? How come no one had any relief for us?

4951	I don't think that the students have changed dramatically in two weeks, rather the point is that I got to know them better and gained a relationship with them. Thus, I can better understand the behavior of individual students and it does not come to me only as a constant disturbance, which is therefore still at a higher level than I would have imagined. As part of my internship, I have already completed additional lessons of my own teaching.

This confirmed to me what I want to try in class next week. Longer to wait for complete peace in class. The English teacher (at the same time their classroom teacher) went on a trip to the Sevens.

1344	The presence of another trainee, Klara, who comes from Slovenia, is a great diversification of teaching in some classes. These classes then take place bilingually (Czech-English). Because the teacher is also an Englishwoman, she knows what the children understand and what needs to be translated into Czech. A beautiful example of the integration of interdisciplinary relationships into teaching. However, I perceive a very high number of pupils in each class as a big disadvantage at this school.

1123	I have noticed that I often have trouble understanding students' speech. To those who misinterpreted art, I understood little or I deduced it from the context. For others, however, I often did not recognize even a hint of the word and I had to ask the teacher. I was surprised at how the teacher was able to recognize what the student was saying, and I was also reassured by the teacher's message that it took her several weeks to understand some words.

4650	So how to evaluate such a student? Does everything really affect his disorder or does the student already rely on the fact that he simply does not have to do anything?

296	In recent days, I have had the opportunity to look at my accompanying teachers in their further approvals. In the case of history it was geography, in the case of German natural history. With both accompanying teachers, I noticed the same teaching styles, ways of communicating with students, which I could see in our common subjects. Geography was more in a modern style, based, similar to history, on activities on an interactive whiteboard. Pupils got involved, they enjoyed it.

The topic of this lesson was a new substance - counting fractions. The teacher noticed that there were 5 students in the class after a long absence, so he devoted enough time to repetition."

1986	Today, the boy, who usually just keeps silent all the time and doesn't seem to notice, even cooperated with me. All he had to do was ask something he knew. Sevens are a little more angry, but if it's not just a frontal explanation and something they don't know is included here and there and it will confiscate them and show them the subject matter from another point of view, they can cooperate and tilt them to your side.

1365	I found out that it really makes a difference to teach individual grades. I'm quite struggling with the fact that I don't like teaching six. As such, the juveniles seem to me like first-grade children. It's a bit easier for sevens, but it's not getting interesting until it's eight.

3704	In every class, I came to the conclusion that they are addicted to social networks, mobile phones and also that they do not like it. We stopped at this point, and I let them think and say the reasons why, and listened to their suggestions on what should be changed to make it fun. In some classes, there was also the question of whether some theoretical things (history, etc.) or only contemporary music should be discussed in music education.

3174	Another text was the Epic of Gilgamesh. The text expressed great grief over the loss of a friend, hopelessness over the transience of life. Perhaps they were even more lost in this text.

4947	When I entered the classroom, I was horrified. Not only from the height of the students, but also from their views. I said calm down, keep a cool head, it can't derail you. I took the lessons, introduced myself politely and told them that I wanted to be nice and pleasant to them, and I expected the same from them.

1348	The doctor advised me to always be silent when the students start to make noise. And I can't start talking until he calms down completely. She warned me that this method would take a lot of time from the beginning, but let me not be afraid to sacrifice a few hours that it would pay off a hundredfold. Pupils will get used to the rules, they will understand that if they follow them, the lessons will be pleasant for everyone. In my Czech lessons, I met a girl who did not cooperate at all.

1729	According to the teacher, I always bring energy to the class, but it disappears with the opening of the textbook. Honestly, maybe it also shows that the textbook itself doesn't bother me much and how is it supposed to entertain the students? I'm investing a lot of time in preparing lessons now and I'm absolutely shocked whenever the teacher just looks at the schedule and already knows what will be in class to do.

2960	Few people spoke well. It was three words - an emigrant, an idea, a case. The teacher told me that if I wanted, I could also score and mark the tests.	Honestly, I didn't dare!	Difficulty	[2, 2]
2085	This procedure of working on a new curriculum did not seem very correct to me and I personally would not dare to use it in teaching. I would certainly calculate more examples with them on the board so that they can see clearly how to calculate it and I would not leave it to the students themselves. The practice is starting to gain in importance and I am changing my position from observer to teacher. I thought the preparations would be much harder.

6272	My main advantage is that I am a man. Only about how the students perceive me and take me compared to my female colleagues is quite familiar. Sure, women are better in some categories of curriculum and teaching, but the guy is something that is missing in schools. Whether it is authority as such or just an example of a model. For example, only in terms of teaching workshops at elementary schools.	Sure, women are better in some categories of curriculum and teaching, but the guy is something that is missing in schools.

1775	Although students have different relationships with each teacher that determine the climate in a given lesson, each class is specific. Surely someone else would have a different class.

6179	In the beginning, the children counted when they have to start writing the test, when they need 25 minutes for it and it rings 8:45. They practiced rounding in place of units, tens and hundreds.

1524	I answer that in November. I raise my voice slightly and declare that I will not only rehearse, but also give papers, as I see how they treat the teacher and do not respect the assigned tasks.

4108	One of the things I still want to work on is definitely grasping the curriculum so that it is understandable for all students. I will give an example: For two hours I explained a certain grammatical phenomenon, I marked everything with colored markers on the board, gave the students the necessary materials, showed them the page in the textbook where they can find everything, created a lot of activities to support the subject matter and still it was not enough . The students kept saying it wrong. I didn't see a small shift until the end of the second hour. And so I ask myself the question: So is the mistake on my side?

Teachers can't get everyone's attention because they're not paying attention, making noise or sleeping when they're teaching at the blackboard. When the teacher walks around the classroom and is on the right, there is noise on the left, etc. And again, I encounter very low motivation among students.

4437	Maybe if such a situation occurred, I would already be eliminating some inappropriate practices that I should avoid in the future. . . I teach English in the first grade.

7020		In the second lesson, I saw another student spinning with scissors on his finger and then stabbing the girl in the hair in front of him.	Experience	[4, 5]
4869	If someone stepped on me like that, I'm sure I'd close, I'd probably get mad and I wouldn't be working by the end of the class. In the second half of the lesson, the students worked independently in the desks. During this time, the boy with PAS developed motor restlessness.	In the second half of the lesson, the students worked independently in the desks.	Other	[5, 6]
4838	On the other hand, it probably wouldn't help anything here, rather the students would probably start jumping out of the windows, if only I were there with them. In the second half of the internship, I struggled a bit with health problems, so I couldn't complete all the lessons. However, I submitted a signed summary of what I taught, stamped from school, so I hope it doesn't matter. I will still have to make an appointment for the next semester due to the observation.	In the second half of the internship, I struggled a bit with health problems, so I couldn't complete all the lessons.	Difficulty	[4, 6]
5559	The teacher walks around the students and talks to them. He then makes a call with the assistant. A girl is crying in the classroom, the teacher sent her to the toilet to cry. I wonder if something can't happen to her, so I wouldn't let her go to the bathroom alone. However, the teacher addresses the assistant to go and look after the girl. I will be relieved.	I wonder if something can't happen to her?	Reflection	[6, 4]
1391	After the explanation, the students went to make the thing. During the lesson, the teacher and I walked among the students, explaining the assignments and showing the correct procedure. In the workshops, it occurs to me that the work is more individual, always about checking the correct procedure and adhering to work safety. It strikes me as strange that there were only 16 desks in the workshop, while there are 20 pupils in the class. It is a pity that an hour of work activities lasts only one lesson.	In the workshops, it occurs to me that the work is more individual, always about checking the correct procedure and adhering to work safety.	Reflection	[1, 3]
3839	In environmental education, we discuss topics such as ozone, drought in the Czech Republic, plastics in the oceans. Usually we try an interesting form of teaching (insert method, pair reading, statement tables, snowball method, ...) but we still get everything from most classes with one word or no answer.	In environmental education, we discuss topics such as ozone, drought in the Czech Republic, plastics in the oceans.	Experience	[5, 5]
5986	At the beginning, I thought it was simple, but gradually I thought about what I would prepare for this topic for the whole 45 minutes? I had various ideas in my head, but without preparation I would probably cook a very strong chicken broth. . . . I am a very content topic. . .	I had various ideas in my head, but without preparation I would probably cook a very strong chicken broth there ....	Reflection	[3, 4]
4855	The next lesson was to teach me the same thing, just in the second grade, including the fact that we were to write the same test. It was running through my head, how would I deal with it when I caught someone describing it, of course I understand that it is a very individual question and everyone solves it differently, but how is it right?	It was running through my head, how would I deal with it when I caught someone copying it?	Reflection	[5, 6]
3375	It doesn't even work with anyone. Is it because she's a tiny and quiet woman? I'm still wondering if it's because of the overall look and gender. I sit and wonder if I, as a seventh grade student, made gender differences between teachers. She didn't. I don't think so.	The thought keeps popping into my head as to whether this is due to the overall appearance and gender.	Reflection	[2, 5]
1850	The teacher has stopped rehearsing and just asks me in a low voice if she can let me go for class. I agree. There are a lot of thoughts in my head, but especially that I can handle it. So I was left alone in the classroom and asked the students why they were not trying to do exercises for which they could get a grade one. They tell me that they didn't know what to do for the exercise.	There are a lot of thoughts in my head, but especially that I can handle it.	Belief	[5, 4]
5669	In class, the children were otherwise divided into groups in which they worked most of the hour. . . The first task was to characterize what is healthy and unreasonably self-confident and to give a few examples. . .	In class, the children were otherwise divided into groups, in which they worked most of the hour ...	Other	[6, 5]
919	In computer science classes, I did functions with children in Excel, and from the beginning we managed to do half of the things I had ready with children, because in computer science classes I did functions with children in Excel. , which I had prepared, because in the 4th and 5th grade, they are only talking about the keyboard and typing with the representative in IT. and writing. However, even in this the students were not capable and had problems with writing = etc.	In computer science lessons, I did functions with children in Excel, and from the beginning we managed to do half of the things I had ready with the children, because in the 4th and 5th grade, they are only talking about the keyboard and typing with the IT representative.	Experience	[4, 5]
1683	Before I could continue, I found myself shouting at the children. Many times in the class I was forced to raise my voice, but never as much as then. Was it too much? Should I have handled the situation differently? Probably yes. But I tried a lot of other techniques, including silence or raising my hand and waiting for silence.	Many times in the class I was forced to raise my voice, but never as much as then.	Experience	[4, 6]
3970	But lately, it seems to me that the students are a little calmer here. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm used to it. In math class it is another oasis. I don't think the difference is explicitly given by the teacher. I think that the difference is mainly given by the subject.	In math class it is another oasis.	Other	[6, 5]
1194	And now the opposite problem. One of the students is very enthusiastic about natural history. He does not interrupt in class, he is careful, he often asks about various contexts and he keeps careful notes. Sometimes I am surprised by information that I had no idea about. This student also suffers from a certain disorder.	He does not interrupt in class, he is careful, he often asks about various contexts and he keeps careful notes.	Other	[6, 6]
1681	"To the clock itself. My own feeling was that I managed it quite well. Of course, I feel that the most important thing is to charge such certainty and sovereignty in interpretation. I also feel better and more natural in class when I am alone in class and do not have ""supervision"". As for the reaction of students to my person and the way of teaching, I find it positive from my point of view."	"I also feel better and more natural in class when I am alone in class and do not have ""supervision""."	Feeling	[6, 5]
262	The children are looking forward to home and lunch and so they are already excited. In class, I like to talk to students and discuss topics that fit into our study plan. I try to make them enjoy the lessons with me and take something away from them.	In class, I like to talk to students and discuss topics that fit into our study plan.	Experience	[4, 5]
6217	I also do observations in Czech language classes. The teacher is pleasant, sometimes a little more forceful. Before the first hour of civic education I was to lead, I had a natural concern and respect.	I also do observations in Czech language classes.	Experience	[5, 5]
6832	And for each of them, various support measures are set up. One child diagnosed with ADHD has an assigned assistant. In English lessons, however, the teaching assistant on Thursday is not for the reason described above. The first opportunity to listen in this class occurred to me in a Czech language class. I was sitting in the back with a child with attention deficit disorder.	In English lessons, however, the teaching assistant on Thursday is not for the reason described above.	Other	[5, 6]
2730	I agreed because I think it's a perfect option. I haven't been to a music lesson yet, my accompanying teacher teaches her, but she only teaches one hour a week, so I'll go to music for my teacher.	I haven't been to a music lesson yet, my accompanying teacher teaches her, but she only teaches one hour a week, so I'll go to music for my teacher.	Experience	[3, 3]
1459	"The assignment of the lesson ""process / create the logo of the Liberec region"" seemed meaningless to me and I could not imagine that in this way the teacher can discuss the subject with the pupils. But in class I understood what was meant and I have to say that it was a great activity that entertained the students. They developed beautiful logos, which included all the important information that characterizes the region, is typical for it."	But in class I understood what was meant and I have to say that it was a great activity that entertained the students.	Experience	[4, 2]
6789	During homework, I thought how easy it is for students to do offs and stuff. In class, I found out the exact opposite. They didn't succeed at all. Class without rhythmic feeling. But not to hurt everyone, the girls did much better than the boys.	In class, I found out the exact opposite.	Learning	[3, 4]
3987	The students who got on my nerves last week were complete sweethearts this time (maybe it was also because there were a little fewer of them). I enjoyed the lesson in class, the students cooperated and it came to me as such a friendly conversation. I came up with various interesting things to tell the students, in short, this time I wanted to be active.	I enjoyed the lesson in class, the students cooperated and it came to me as such a friendly conversation.	Feeling	[4, 4]
2258	I had the same beginning as in the ninth grade. Introduction and setting of rules. The students agreed to me, but also complied. There was a grave silence in the classroom that I could hear a falling pin. I worked very well in the class, the students responded to my suggestions. They were very disciplined. At the end, I played them a repeat of a 3-minute video, where everything I taught them was heard. I ended the class with a big thank you.	I worked very well in the class, the students responded to my suggestions.	Reflection	[5, 3]
4148	I feel weird thinking about such a thing at all. But I still wonder where the limits are. I don't know why, it just stopped me. A pupil with ADHD is inclusive in a Czech language lesson. He is sitting in the first bench and has almost nothing in front of him except a notebook and a pencil. The teacher employs him with erasing the board and other small things.	A pupil with ADHD is inclusive in a Czech language lesson.	Other	[6, 5]
2788	I really like that this school leads children to respect and pride, and that national identity has a lot of space here. In the hospital class, I met VaÅ¡ek again, whom I had to reprimand last week. The first thing the teacher told him was to clean things around the desk. And really, he had things scattered around his place, textbooks, crayons. . . No horror!	In the hospital class, I met VaÅ¡ek again, whom I had to reprimand last week.	Experience	[5, 5]
1505	In music education, I prepared a method of dramatizing songs. In general, there is no time left for dramatization both in music education and in the Czech language.	In music education, I prepared a method of dramatizing songs.	Experience	[5, 6]
1609	I don't mind, I'm glad I can relieve them a little and they leave me a free hand in teaching. In computer science, the lessons are much calmer and more comfortable. I always have only half the class, so there is more peace in class. Teaching a citizen is more challenging for me.	In computer science, the lessons are much calmer and more comfortable.	Other	[2, 5]
2511	The stenciled assignment theming autumn, specifically of course the leaves, did not actually surprise me. I was fascinated by a group of three boys sitting in the last benches. At any free moment, they were drawing something, not even moving during the break. When I went to see what they were doing, I was pleasantly surprised. They drew sci-fi comics about radioactive cacti and waste rocketing into space.	At any free moment, they were drawing something, not even moving during the break.	Other	[6, 6]
1373	When someone had any comments, I immediately responded. At one point, I realized that I was grateful to the faculty. And that I could tell myself when I have had enough of listening and when I want to start teaching.	At one point, I realized that I was grateful to the faculty.	Experience	[1, 3]
4998	But that didn't apply to the students either. At one point I noticed that the teacher was actually explaining the subject only to me, because no one else was listening to him. He also tried it well with them. He tried not to shout at them and say everything in peace, but maybe it was even worse.	At one point I noticed that the teacher was actually explaining the subject only to me, because no one else was listening to him.	Experience	[6, 3]
2419	I believe that this is an exception and in other cabinets there is much more peace of mind during breaks. I'm looking forward to the next lessons I will lead! In one lesson I experienced a situation where the students were absolutely unbearable. They had fun, interrupted, the teacher tried several times to clean up the situation in the classroom, but without success. I felt sorry for the teacher and the few people who were careful.	At one o'clock I listened to a situation where the students were absolutely unbearable.	Experience	[5, 5]
3005	"Very nice hours in fifth grade, interactive, everyone involved. In one lesson I used objects from my holiday in Exeter, the pupils could go through them and ask me questions in the past tense (grammar studied). All enthusiastic, huge interest in subjects. Drill on the board - new substance = discuss the verbs ""went"", ""saw"" and ""bought""."	In one lesson I used objects from my holiday in Exeter, the pupils could go through them and ask me questions in the past tense (grammar studied).	Experience	[5, 4]
181	During the ensuing, I was surprised that the students have a relatively large knowledge. During the lessons, I found out that it is not so hot again. They have knowledge, but they cannot use it. In one-eighth grade, they are already stuck in determining grammatical categories for nouns. I therefore admit that the task was set in the opposite direction, as usual, they had to look for words in the text for the relevant patterns and determine their gender, number and case.	In one-eighth grade, they are already stuck in determining grammatical categories for nouns.	Other	[7, 7]
4371	"In addition, the students did not know what the number would mean (the teacher joked that it would be their mark on the report card). In one class, the group work worked quite well, there was always someone who knew and who ""led"" the group. Only one group didn't work very well."	"In one class, the group work worked quite well, there was always someone who knew and who ""led"" the group."	Other	[5, 6]
5913	Two, in which there were students with moderate mental disabilities and one with severe mental disabilities. Of course, there were differences in the behavior of students in individual classes and also in teaching. In one class, a student sang a song that was very long and difficult to remember. He added to the value of the song the student's speech and the purity of the tone.	In one class, a student sang a song that was very long and difficult to remember.	Other	[6, 6]
4989	In one of the lessons I met that a school inspection had arrived and due to the fact that my accompanying teacher is the deputy principal, he did not manage to come to class, so 10 minutes before the class he informed me that I would have an hour with them. I felt pretty bad because I didn't anticipate it at all, nor did I know what they were doing and what they weren't doing, so my own class was completely improvised.

944	She calmly sacrifices a long break to make a dance hall in the auditorium for the students. In this regard, I think I can take an example. There is a great atmosphere in her lessons, a friendly mood, the lessons are fun for the pupils, the teacher adapts the teaching to the given team, which she knows very well. I certainly have a partial role model in the teacher.

4123	All the while they listened, asked questions, laughed. When I discussed everything with the teacher after class, we agreed that a miracle must have happened. There are no problems with them in her classes, but other teachers complain quite often. The teacher even confided to me that when she arrived at the classroom about half an hour, she was afraid she had mistaken the classroom for hearing voices and laughter.	There are no problems with them in her classes, but other teachers complain quite often.	Other	[6, 4]
2189	In one class, a student sang a song that was very long and difficult to remember. He added to the value of the song the student's speech and the purity of the tone. In another class, there were students who discussed the topic with me and participated in teaching, which of course I was happy about. Occasionally, discussions and comments were not requested. I have noticed that sometimes I have a problem dealing with these children or reacting to certain situations.	In another class, there were students who discussed the topic with me and participated in teaching, which of course I was happy about.	Feeling	[4, 4]
5198	I really rested. For the rest of the hour, I felt much more relaxed, following the principal's procedures and ways of working with this gifted class. In the office, after an hour, we analyzed the individual passages of teaching, which was a benefit for me.

4173	The eighth classes both have a special team. None of these classes are common. In each of these classes, there are at least 2 pupils who act as if they have been separated from the collective. They function as separate units and do not communicate with others. Which is definitely wrong. . .

3578	As a result, the teacher did not give me any feedback, she just asked again about some didactics according to which we study at university and praised me for singing students. In contrast to this teacher, I saw the music education of the teacher in 6. A. He gave them 15-20 minutes to prepare and then they performed in groups.	In contrast to this teacher, I saw the music education of the teacher in 6.A.	Experience	[3, 5]
5424	I have a wonderful feeling from the lessons led in this way. I leave full of energy and with the feeling that learning makes sense and that I was born for it. In contrast, however, is the next lesson in the 6th D (where group integration takes place), where I think in vain about the meaning of my pedagogical mission. When I see how some students can't even sign properly, I try in vain to maintain the heat within me, which can make me a better teacher.	In contrast, however, is the very next lesson in 6.D (where group integration takes place), where I think in vain about the meaning of my pedagogical mission.	Reflection	[6, 2]
996	But they are also not among the better. They are still at an age when puberty has the main say and have no problem ignoring teachers. I had one hospital lesson in the fifth grade to see how they were doing, and they could get used to me a little too. When I saw the commotion my presence caused, I was terrified this week of having to step up behind the department and communicate with them.	I had one hospital lesson in the fifth grade to see how they were doing, and they could get used to me a little too.	Experience	[3, 6]
552	Setting: There is a student in the sixth grade. He was sitting in the back at the beginning of the year, now sitting in the left front. A girl is sitting on a bench with him. When I was attending a history class by their class teacher (a reputation for pure evil, no one can afford to spit on), he was more or less speechless.	A girl is sitting on a bench with him.	Other	[5, 4]
361	She is a former high school professor who earns extra money in this form. In the last lesson, I described to the students why we were celebrating November 17th, and one of the students then asked me what I thought about communism. I wanted to start answering him in style, I'll tell you my opinion, but don't take it as a coin, communism today is different.	In the last lesson, I described to the students why we were celebrating November 17th, and one of the students then asked me what I thought about communism.	Experience	[6, 5]
1521	"I'm excited about all the history lessons and I'm starting to realize the really striking difference between teaching in elementary school compared to lower grammar school. In the last semester, when I attended a classic elementary school, I perceived everything in the style of ""we'll talk about it and it will be"". While at the grammar school, I feel a great responsibility for the future of the students in the form of mastering the high school diploma, because only me and no other teacher is responsible for all their knowledge and understanding."	"In the last semester, when I attended a classic elementary school, I perceived everything in the style of ""we'll talk about it and it will be""."	Experience	[5, 2]
2908	My second colleague has only been teaching for a few years, but listening to her is also beneficial for me. In the last few days, I was listening in various years of the second grade, I also got a lesson in homeland studies in the fourth grade. The classes I attended with my colleague were relatively lively and with one class (eighth grade) more teachers having problems. When they arrived in class, their indiscipline was evident.	In the last few days, I was listening in various years of the second grade, I also got a lesson in homeland studies in the fourth grade.	Experience	[2, 6]
5420	I listened for the first few hours. The audacity of the children always confirms to me that I really hope that I will never have to work in the second grade.	The moment the young lady from the 9th grade is rude to the teacher because she was confiscated by the cell phone for the rest of the class, I thought that I really don't have the nerve for this.	Reflection	[4, 6]
524	It is one thing to plan at home how it will go after each other, what I will ask the students, what I will explain, but the other thing is the reality of the lesson. In my history class, my teacher and I always agree on a lot of things we want to accomplish - either alone or together. Usually we prepare a short test at the beginning, then I have my part of the explanation, where I always try to have a lot of questions and things that I can ask students.	In my history class, my teacher and I always agree on a lot of things we want to accomplish - either alone or together.	Experience	[3, 4]
2996	But I dread the difference between a village school and a town school. Is my fear justified? Are the children in the village different from the big city? In my imagination, yes, but I don't want to have prejudices, I'm just a natural fear. When I think about it, maybe I think too much about everything around respect.	In my imagination, yes, but I don't want to have prejudices, I only have a natural fear.	Feeling	[3, 2]
1332	Last but not least, the question arises as to how to state the next hour following the hour in which a more pronounced situation took place. Is it appropriate to return to the situation and address it in some way, or is it best not to mention it further?	Last but not least, the question arises as to how to state the next hour following the hour in which a more pronounced situation took place.	Reflection	[3, 3]
6871	Even though I have already learned all the lessons at this school, I continue to teach, because we finally realized at this school that it is something I will enjoy. In some classes, I teach without an associate teacher, so it's up to me to put my classes in order. Unfortunately, this semester I caught a lifeless topic, which I have to discuss in the 9th grade in civics lessons.	In some classes, I teach without an associate teacher, so it's up to me to put my classes in order.	Experience	[5, 5]
205	Eventually, the student was given a note and sat by the end of the lesson and did nothing. At such moments, I think about how complex and difficult the profession is. In some situations, teachers are powerless and have relatively few resources to achieve what they need. I myself did not feel good about the situation and I wondered what led the student to (not only) treat the teacher in this way.	In some situations, teachers are powerless and have relatively few resources to achieve what they need.	Belief	[4, 5]
4444	In some classes, there was also the question of whether some theoretical things (history, etc.) or only contemporary music should be discussed in music education. To my delight, the whole class always came to the conclusion that even a theoretical overview should be taken away from school.

836	I do something practically every hour. In history, I have all the tandems ready, and in one lesson I taught all by myself. In civics, we skipped the tandem due to lack of time and I taught it for 2 hours all by myself. It's unbelievable how much it fills me, it occurs to me that the children take me, that they enjoy it with me and that they take something away from those classes.	In civics, we skipped the tandem due to lack of time and I taught it for 2 hours all by myself.	Experience	[4, 5]
6449	For the first three weeks, I only went to listen. In civics, it concerned the first and second, which correspond to the sixth and seventh grades of primary school. And in the history of these two classes as well, as well as quarters, which are ninth graders.	In civics, it concerned the first and second, which correspond to the sixth and seventh grades of primary school.	Other	[6, 6]
4495	In addition, again, there is a problem with inclusion, which I do not agree with, and that is why I do not want to go to education. In the eighth grade, there is a boy with autism who is completely out of it. Why should kids like him bother with another language? I don't know how it is with aj, but he only gives German because his assistant dictates it to him.	In the eighth grade, there is a boy with autism who is completely out of it.	Other	[6, 5]
5484	"Outline of the situation: I was told that the group I was going to teach was the weakest of the eighth groups and that they had to be treated as clearly as possible. The topic of clothing is currently being discussed in the eights, and it occurred to me that the children somehow give the sentence constructions such as ""it's too (expencive)"" and ""it's not (big) enough"", which logically fits into the topic under discussion. The course itself: First I pulled the students off the benches and in the back of the class we stood in a circle."

4098	Several students often disturb and do not pay attention in class. After entering the classroom, there was still a roar, the children were restless and had no teaching aids ready. Basically few who noticed that the class began. The teacher closed the door emphatically and instructed them to calm down and settle on the benches. At least six students still did what they wanted.	Basically few who noticed that the class began.	Other	[5, 6]
5944	"The beautiful cooperation of the lecturer and the teacher was seen. If the student got lost or was unsure of something, the teacher helped him. Basically, it was about teaching in tandem.

During the ""presentation"" of the topic, the children usually supplemented the worksheets prepared for them by their classmate - the ""teacher""."	Basically, it was about teaching in tandem.	Other	[6, 6]
6241	Each student chose one topic and had the task to prepare and process it for a certain date. Every hour, two students were given space to show what they had prepared. Basically, they played the teacher for part of the lesson (about 15 minutes) and instead of the teacher, the other classmates taught the subject. I had the opportunity to see one such hour and I can say that I was excited.

She didn't interfere with anything, he just slipped in speed.	In the middle of the lesson, the teacher that the students normally have arrived.	Other	[6, 6]
1217	Eventually, they all sat down at their computers and worked on their own presentations. During this time, I walked between them and watched them work, or helped them. In the middle of the lesson, my teacher called me and explained what I had forgotten and what he would have done differently. However, his methods and knowledge were used more in older versions of PowerPoint. You can see how important it is to constantly monitor new trends in teaching and not freeze in one place.

2971	I therefore consider my experience with observation to be very positive. I am also happy for such an initial experience, because now I know that in the future I no longer have to worry about hospitalization. In fact, lately, I've been increasingly terrified by the idea that I would really teach art in elementary school. So many children, noise, disciplinary problems that need to be addressed instead of concentrating on teaching - the content of the lessons.

In the last song, I ruined the accompaniment, so I told them that they were better than me now, and that I thank them for how well they did. And they appreciated me by applause.

2593	Every hour is carried in such a spirit. I almost wish to experience some wilder class, as this is a paradise on earth for a beginning teacher. In recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to try, among other things, teaching literature in two classes of the ninth grade. I was very much looking forward to it, because internally I feel that as a future teacher it draws me more to high school, and ninth graders are already very close to it.

1323	On Friday morning, however, an unpleasant surprise awaited me - only 4 students arrived for the class. The reason?

2680	The presence of a native speaker-student of the University of Vienna, Gabriel, helped a lot. Gabriel actively worked with the students and soon became (especially among girls) a very popular member of our teaching group.

3691	The biggest weakness for me is the Czech grammar. Due to the not yet very extensive and practically taught didactics at the faculty, I am quite interested in how to teach grammar (and style). On Friday, I taught a total of 5 out of six hours spent in practice, of which 2 breaks were supervised. I was afraid I would be tired of such a busy day.

3965	It's a better practice for me. In addition, my teacher told me that he did not recognize the hearings. So, apart from the first listening hour, we basically had no listening with him. Not much has changed in my teaching practice since my last visits. I still work as an assistant and I go to school every day in the first grade. In the class I mainly focus on five children who have written IVP.	Not much has changed in my teaching practice since my last visits.	Experience	[4, 2]
1047	At that moment, I was completely embarrassed. This has never happened to me yet. I think I will like this class a lot in the rest of the internship.

4715	I mainly felt this during the subscription performance, when it was necessary to count the children before leaving so that we would not forget someone. The teacher also educates future generations, which is a damn big responsibility. As part of my practice, I have already tried out for myself what it is like to teach.

In this regard, I think I can take an example. There is a great atmosphere in her lessons, a friendly mood, the lessons are fun for the pupils, the teacher adapts the teaching to the given team, which she knows very well. I certainly have a partial role model in the teacher.	In this regard, I think I can take an example.	Reflection	[6, 3]
6943	But the reality is, at least at the school where I practice, different. Natural history is taught only one hour a week. At that moment, one question came to my mind. How should teachers diversify children's lessons while discussing all the subjects that primary school pupils should be able to master? It seems to me that it is quite a superhuman performance.

6918	I realized that there is a relatively thin line between when it makes sense to punish students with a test and when it is better to withdraw from a test.

4196	In the math class, examples usually count for the rest of the lesson, and I am often amazed at the skill of students who are good at genetics. In the second, general class, the new material was explained to the students, so I paid close attention to the teaching methods of the principal, who I thought did very well. I liked that he used a presentation and an interactive whiteboard for his lesson, which took care of the pupils' attention until the end of the lesson.

6925	On the other hand, however, it leads to falling into a routine and sticking to one scheme that best meets the requirements of the accompanying teacher for the objectives of the lesson. As a result, it happened to me that I worked out some lessons in a form that I didn't enjoy very much, which I thought I could conceptually work on better myself if I wasn't limited by the set goal of the lesson accompanying the teacher, but could work on the topic at my own discretion. , and I believe that, as a result, these lessons did not entertain the pupils either, which was also reflected in the achievement (or rather failure to achieve) of the set goals. Another fact is that when I tried to do the lesson in a slightly different way (predominantly inductive style) I came across another problem that I did not expect.

The course of the German language lesson was designed so that the students would not be bored by simply buffering grammar and vocabulary.

529	This approach uses the natural curiosity and creative potential of children to learn them. All learning takes place very spontaneously in thematic projects.

6212	The other two variants transfer responsibility to the student. Unfortunately, when children rewrite it themselves, they copy it inattentively and make mistakes there, and then they do it wrong, they learn with those mistakes. I've seen a few dictionaries and some really don't. It's either because they have some dysfunction, or simply because they're not paying attention. Nervousness is a very unpleasant thing.

Since the class I'm teaching in is really big and the students are sitting very far away from me, I would shout my vocal cords before explaining anything to them. That's why I invited them all closer to the board and explained all the theory to them and showed them what would be done today.

2260	The teacher also mentioned that the student would never tell her what she was having problems with at school and asked me if I could find out. Since I was in charge of only one student, I was able to apply a purely individual approach. We read and wrote together for a while. And we interspersed each activity with a short conversation. I asked him about hobbies, travel, school, etc.	Since I was in charge of only one student, I was able to apply a purely individual approach.	Experience	[6, 4]
1519	In my latest diary from practice, I would like to reflect on my two lessons, which I taught in English last week. Since my very first lesson took place without the presence of my accompanying teacher (I replaced the lesson for him), when I had to teach another lesson in front of him, I was a little scared. I know it's definitely an advantage, because after an hour you get feedback and you know what you did well and what you did wrong.

6370	After such a time, I had no idea what it looked like at elementary school and teaching was going on. The kind teacher was a nice, experienced teacher. Given that the second field has physical education and the cabinet is shared with another gymnast, I feel like I'm in my element. I thought, I'd like to see myself in a place like this in a few years. The atmosphere seemed very friendly to me, as we athletes, as we call teamwork.

6120	What is very difficult, however, is to be able to meet the hours we have to learn and spend at school. Due to the fact that we have our schedule at the faculty, in most subjects almost no one wants to apologize to the compulsory attendance and practice. For example, health education is taught three times a week and to make it even harder, students always have some excursions, sports events or holidays.

Due to the fact that I go to practice on Mondays and Tuesdays, she has now dropped out for a long time. It was related to the autumn holidays and also to the fact that I was ill for some time. So far, I have such conflicting feelings about the practice as a whole.	Due to the fact that I go to practice on Mondays and Tuesdays, she has now dropped out for a long time.	Experience	[3, 4]
6344	Before I move on and how and what I taught, a note on my English class visits. Since I am not studying classical Czech, but OMJ, I consider it relatively important to be familiar with the acquisition of a foreign language in students. For this, listening in an English class, where the teacher communicates almost exclusively in English, is good material.

3022	I am also looking forward to teaching in higher grades, where it suited me better in the past. Due to the fact that the internship started recently and there were several complications - the accompanying teacher was ill and health education is taught at school only 3 times a week and these times do not fit my schedule, which I have at school, because my teaching is overlapped, I she was in practice only once, for listening.

2294	This idea still accompanies me, but I hope that only I think about it and not the students. I remember that my classmates and I loved young teachers more than older ones.

2923	After a few minutes, I returned to them and stood by them, checking the outcome of the task of at least one student. Then the teacher arrived and together the three of them started showing the solution of the tasks on the board, while the teacher wrote and both students actively cooperated with her, they knew the material and they knew it. This is how the rest of the hour went. Even after almost fourteen days, when this situation happened, I sometimes remember it, it was a rare experience for my teaching practice.

6483	Rather, how children can work alone and in the team, and often about relationships. The teacher often has to resolve some conflicts between students and reprimand their behavior.

4299	I am starting to do practice one together with practice three, which means that I have a lot of teaching and apparently a lot of my own preparation and ideas. I know, I'm counting on it, so I deliberately left time for practice for a whole month. But it's still challenging.

3574	I can't say that they shouldn't surprise me with anything, but at least I already know a little bit about what I can or can't expect from them, and even the preparations are easier for me. I know which class to prepare for longer training, because it is a special class of eighth graders, where each student has specific learning disabilities, and since their health education class takes place on Tuesday at six o'clock, it is almost a superhuman performance to develop they have some activity, conversation or at least an interest in the topic being discussed.

6890	As soon as I confessed to my work, they joked that it was harassment in the workplace. I know it might have been inappropriate, but my friend and I have a good relationship, and I know I haven't crossed a line. It happened about 14 days ago on the way home from school.

6279	In retrospect, I thought that I could at least suggest a slightly different solution to the teacher. Because I was in practice the first day, I didn't know what I could talk about and what I couldn't. I know that maybe the teacher would not take advice from me, but at least she would listen to me and for the next time she would act a little differently.

3127	I think it was really long, and in addition, the student explained to everyone a little confused about why a rabbit could not cross with a hare. I know it's because they have a different number of chromosomes, but the little girl got involved so that neither the class nor the she knew. I definitely didn't want to interrupt her, because she was arranged with the teacher at the paper.

2457	I know it's definitely an advantage, because after an hour you get feedback and you know what you did well and what you did wrong.

5844	"In practice, it happens to me that I cannot estimate when I should come to the child's help and when, on the contrary, I should let him ""torment"" himself with the problem.

2978	Therefore, I try to make preparation, in which I also make notes when and what I want to say (eg when switching to another activity). I know I have a problem with the head being faster than my mouth, so I have to be very controlled and slow down during class. I try to work on calming down and being able to learn for an hour in peace and with a clear head. It's Friday morning and I'm sitting in class 7.

2525	Anyway, as I wrote above, on the one hand it is beneficial. I know that children need really simple language - so somehow I finally know what to think of it.

6557	I'm sure this is not for me. I kept wondering if German as a single major study would be small, but now I'm happy for it. I know that if I stayed only in primary school, the level of my language would drop rapidly, so I would look for other teaching options than just in primary school. However, this can have a positive effect on me not falling into the stereotype, and yet I will have some motivation to teach in primary school.

3510	It really wasn't better, on the contrary. I know that, for example, teachers even say to themselves when the atmosphere in the classroom is not exactly inclined to the atmosphere, so I was thinking about how to deal with such pre-announced information. Should I discount the claims before such an hour and make it lighter? Or should I go to class and hope to get her under control and do something?

I know that I am not yet in the role of a teacher who does the same work year after year and bothered with the same things, so she is perhaps happy for every opportunity for change, time off, rest. Nevertheless, we will not tell the students anything today, it did not seem very appropriate to me. To my surprise, the repetition began before ""doing nothing""."

2931	I think that teaching health is beneficial for the pupils in the classroom where I had the opportunity to teach, because it deals with issues from everyday life that are close to them. Teaching in tandem with my accompanying teacher was also an excellent experience for me.

Art education should also include a certain theoretical part, and if at the beginning of the lesson we have a completely insufficient abbreviated version to tell students at least basic information about art style or technology, it will take about 15 minutes, depending on the age of the children. We spend more time explaining the art task, which will take more than half of the first lesson. This will also shorten the creative time of students who cannot fully develop.

1182	I've always been used to everything a student needs to learn in a period of time. Most high school students are taught to get the required curriculum in their heads in one night. After the test or trial, they omit this information from their heads and after a few days they do not remember the substance from which they wrote the test.

6373	Of course, I take into account the presence of the teacher and also the fact that the students saw me teaching for the first time and did not know what they could and could not afford, so they rather observed. Most of the lessons I had attended from an observer's point of view seemed the same to me, so I wondered how to change it a little.

2760	On Friday morning, however, an unpleasant surprise awaited me - only 4 students arrived for the class. Most of them had an information meeting due to an exchange, some went on strike in the climate. In the first lesson, I sang with the students and played on the body. They did the activity for the first time and said they liked it very much.	Most had an information meeting for an exchange, some went on strike in the climate.	Other	[7, 5]

3436	Most were very confident and their communication skills in Germany were, in my estimate, at level B1. Some have struggled with it a bit, but even that is appreciated, not giving up and trying to talk, even if you can't.	Most were very confident and their communication skills in Germany were, in my estimate, at level B1.	Reflection	[4, 4]
6144	From the first two weeks of practice, I have mixed feelings. Most things are solved in the process and for me, as an outside observer, the organization is slightly chaotic. The situation often depends on the composition of the class. Even in the lower grades, prominent personalities are profiled who can change the atmosphere of the classroom or can completely pull down a large part of the pupils.	Most things are solved in the process and for me, as an outside observer, the organization is slightly chaotic.	Experience	[4, 4]
6622	As the last topic of this reflection, I would like to choose the topic of motivating students to learn a foreign language. Most of them are not used to a situation in which their communication partner would not understand them at all. It is also often difficult to explain to pupils why they have to learn that foreign language.	Most of them are not used to a situation in which their communication partner would not understand them at all.	Other	[6, 5]
5082	I really liked that I had time for all the students and could explain to them everything they had wrong with the previous task. Most of the students did the task correctly. It's a pity that they use OpenOffice at school, I work better with Microsoft Word.	Most of the students did the task correctly.	Other	[6, 7]
4597	I even managed to intersperse the stay with a moment of mathematics. Most of the students were not entirely thrilled.

Most of the students were not entirely thrilled.	Other	[5, 6]
3434	In my history class, my teacher and I always agree on a lot of things we want to accomplish - either alone or together. Usually we prepare a short test at the beginning, then I have my part of the explanation, where I always try to have a lot of questions and things that I can ask students.

5277	It took place in the sixth grade, where I had been heard twice before. The teacher is quite strict, but in a talkative class it is only good. Mostly I thought that I would like to have such respect as well. During the ensuing, I immediately noticed two students, a girl and a boy. Even though everyone was sitting elsewhere, they both interrupted for some hour and seldom did what they had to do.	Mostly I thought that I would like to have such respect as well.	Reflection	[4, 5]
2505	Both accompanying teachers are very happy that they can relax and do their own work in their free time, which is not enough. They are usually so busy that we don't even have time to agree on breaks and time off what I have to prepare for next week, so I deal with them on weekends via e-mail. I don't mind, I'm glad I can relieve them a little and they leave me a free hand in teaching. In computer science, the lessons are much calmer and more comfortable.

5418	After every lesson I teach, my accompanying teacher tries to give me some feedback. He usually has a lot of reservations, because I don't directly dictate to the students what to write in the notebook and I ask them a lot. Some will receive a directly printed record (due to SPU) and the rest should have been written by themselves until last week.

7030	On the contrary, those who did not go voluntarily, but under compulsion from the teacher, did not feel very well in front of the blackboard, at least I think. Most of the time, they didn't know what to say and quickly quit to meet it. When the last pair of girls was called by the teacher, neither of them wanted to go. The teacher said that she had to go, otherwise she would evaluate them with a bad grade.	Most of the time, they didn't know what to say and quickly quit to meet it.	Other	[6, 6]
738	Pupils are used to working, they are communicative, so when I ask questions, I always get some answers - calmly and wrong, I'm especially glad that the students communicate with me. Usually I manage to discuss everything I want, it even happened to me in the first lesson that I had a little curriculum ready. It can be seen that the students are used to a faster pace. I think this is also the case because the teacher does not have to deal with disciplinary problems so often in class.

5821	A few weeks ago, I had an unexpected success in practice. When the other teachers were on the ski course, I was again given the nice duty to replace all physical education classes. I have already taught most of the classes in the school for physical education in other subjects, so it was no change for me, but exceptionally I managed to get the eighth grade, in which I have never substituted or paired physical education. I already knew both eighth grades from a few science and chemistry classes, so it wasn't our first meeting, but physical education classes tend to be specific.

1874	The importance of the subject in the whole school is trampled on by the approach of the teacher (the only approved person), who taught a total of 15 minutes from the five hours of listening I witnessed. He spent most of his time arriving late at class, his own work, classroom matters, evaluating nonsensical tasks that students had been given in the last lesson (redrawing pictures, answering questions from a textbook, filling out worksheets, etc.), making phone calls.

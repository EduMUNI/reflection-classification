1139	Some struggled with it a bit, but even that is worth it, not giving up and trying to talk, even if you can't. A few days ago I taught a class of seventh graders (a non-German class) and it was quite sobering for me in the sense that the difference in the knowledge of the previous seventh graders and this one was abysmal.

3566	The student with LMR had an assistant in the class, so I wasn't completely alone with them. I had a very good feeling about some of the children, we worked very well together, some, on the other hand, did not rush to work very much. In the end, however, I managed such a completely unplanned class and felt good about myself.	had a very good feeling about some of the children, we worked very well together, some, on the other hand, did not rush to work very much.

6104	C prepared that it was perhaps the worst class in the school, 30 boys and only 2 girls. They had a teacher from civics who, among other things, also taught physical education and was a coach. I thought to myself that maybe it wouldn't be so terrible, that such a teacher can handle this class. The opposite was true.

8	But I came and ruined everything. In addition, I had the task of writing a short test with them at the beginning of the lesson. And everything was wrong. Of the lessons learned, this one was the most demanding. It took me a while to calm them down and somehow come to an agreement with them.	Of the lessons learned, this one was the most demanding.

2290	The teacher told me that she is happy about it, that even if the result is bad, the children are not bad because of it. That is why they usually write tests, oral examinations are not frequent. I have a good feeling about the teacher, you can really tell that she enjoys her work. I was surprised at how busy the school is. What I saw, but did not investigate further, was that the teacher had no free hours. She had been teaching since morning.	I have a good feeling about the teacher, you can really tell that she enjoys her work.	Feeling	[5, 4]	
4756	I transferred one student who was constantly making a mess to the front desk. I think I handled the situation well, but it didn't help as much as I would have imagined. As a teacher, I would take him in front of the blackboard and test him, but unfortunately, like this. I definitely enjoyed the hours I was in the teaching position and I hope they will continue to grow.

1354	And why is it so or not? From the beginning, I had to force the students to think a little, but when the discussion got going, at least half the class always got involved. In every class I got the impression that they are addicted to social networks, to mobile phones and also that they don't enjoy it.

5879	On the student, you could see that he was slightly separated from the team. He only had one friend to sit with. In the beginning, I was worried that something might happen while I was teaching, because I heard that the student sometimes throws tantrums, but luckily nothing like that has happened during the whole practice period so far. I'm glad I didn't solve any major problem in class.

5747	Health education classes may not be as unmanageable as I first thought. From the beginning I had the feeling that these hours were like moments in the jungle. Not that the teacher didn't have authority or didn't know what to do with the students.	From the beginning I had the feeling that these hours were like moments in the jungle.	Feeling	[5, 5]

2519	But I think she didn't want to show that I couldn't handle it somehow. Rather, she forgot out of habit. I had mixed feelings about the first lesson. Although I accomplished everything I wanted to, I think I came across as very stiff and mechanical. I was hoping that the next 2 hours of the next day would do better.

4894	They seemed to me like children without any difficulties. Mrs. Machýčková was of the same opinion. For me, this was the most skilled group of the whole day. I left the first practice with pleasant feelings. I liked the lessons and the children seemed extremely clever and kind. In other words, visiting the first practices did not deter me!

6023	Time passes at an incredibly fast pace and each of us realizes it more or less at certain moments. I only have the last few hours left of my first practice and I'm starting to realize it more and more.

3072	In practice, I went to music education in the 5th grade, where I had to learn some lessons later. From the first lessons, I noticed that the teacher teaches music education only marginally.

From the first lessons, I noticed that the teacher teaches music education only marginally.	Experience	[5, 4]	
6100	However, the class was a success as a result, everyone joined the discussion beautifully and I thought they enjoyed it. I was really pleasantly surprised by the course of the lesson. In a week, I went to 8. And again to teach civic education. The teacher and I agreed that I would make the class rules with them, which they would then post in the classroom.	I was really pleasantly surprised by the course of the lesson.	Feeling	[6, 6]	
6514	The only thing worth mentioning are the students' reports at the beginning of the lesson. 5 pupils were given a topic in the last lesson, which they had to present to the class. Out of five students, only 3 prepared and it was terrible! The students just found a topic on Wikipedia, wrote two sentences on a piece of paper and then read them to the class. It was obvious that they didn't even understand what they were actually reading to the class.	Out of five students, only 3 prepared and it was terrible!	Difficulties	[6, 3]	
638	They didn't have to prepare extra, they took it home and maybe looked at it. But they had support. From natural conversation, it is difficult to pre-print what students will take home.

4417	My accompanying teacher is of the opinion that I am in school to teach and only through practice will I know if I want to do it. The original plan of a five-minute activity for ninth-graders and a fifteen-minute activity for eighth-graders turned into two whole lessons. I was alone in the ninth grade without supervision.

6753	The teacher's assistant who was present also noted that not only the children but also she herself is afraid of my accompanying teacher in the lessons. However, from what they told me, I didn't have a hard time. I wanted to make a picture of the teacher myself. 6th grade - computer science Right from the first lesson, I had the feeling that the teacher had everything firmly in his hands.

5590	Well, we'll see next semester. It will be a challenge for me. To be honest, I'm still not 100% sure if I want to teach in the future. For that reason, I didn't really want to go to practice and I was afraid of what would await me there. What I evaluate positively is that I enjoyed the 4 lessons and enjoyed preparing interesting activities for the students.	For that reason, I didn't really want to go to practice and I was afraid of what would await me there.	Feeling	[5, 6]	
5553	Why, when the teacher asks a question and the students come in with the answers, does the whole class have to open the notebook and look for the answer? I didn't feel good about it, it shocked me a bit. I could feel the frustration of the students who wanted to answer and didn't get the chance. The role of the school assistant is a mystery to me in some classes.	I didn't have a good feeling about it, it shocked me a bit.	Feeling	[6, 6]	
1867	After 9 long years, I returned back to the school desks. After such a long time, I had no idea what it was like at a primary school and how classes are conducted.	I was sincerely happy because the teacher responded brilliantly to his needs, she saw that he was not good at the specific assignment - capturing reality - and so she modified it, just for him and the boy finally felt success, that was great.

7118	"The next class is something in between - ""brainstorming"" doesn't work very well, but they work well in a group. From this, I concluded that a failed class does not necessarily mean bad preparation. It is a combination of preparation and, above all, the attitude of the students. It was worse with the ninth graders. According to all the teachers, the worst class in the school."	From this, I concluded that a failed class does not necessarily mean bad preparation.	Learning	[4, 5]	
720	However, they all completed the assignments, although for my taste, again understandably appropriate for their age, relatively slowly. It follows from this that I am more comfortable teaching older students, which I also enjoy more, and it confirms my long-term belief that I would rather teach at a secondary school where the students are already older. Even so, I already have another lesson planned in the third year, where I want to try again and not bet, as they say, on the first chance.

2275	Sure, I haven't seen much and maybe I've come across a bad period where pupils represent different industries in pairs and do a project on A3. But I have enough fundamental and surprising knowledge from it. The teacher is a mathematics teacher, so you can see that geography is somehow extra. She actually told me that herself.

3349	At the same time, everything was clearly visible on the computer, but when projected onto the screen, there was a blur.

I supplemented this lesson with a body game.	The lesson from this is that a person gains a lot of experience only through practice.	Learning	[5, 2]	
691	It is true that I could have deliberately called out those students who were not participating in the debate at all, but unfortunately I did not think of it at that moment. For this reason, only those who wanted to spoke spoke. After the students painted their own dream, which was the main assignment of the class, I used the free time to get to know them and find out more about them.	For this reason, only those who wanted to spoke spoke.	Other	[5, 5]	
3863	It is really difficult to work with pupils for several hours, when instead of a complete unit of work for 2 weeks, you have fragmented work for 4 weeks. From this point of view, it is disadvantageous to do long-term projects with pupils, because it really takes a lot of hours. BUT, on the other hand, if the project is well prepared (including work assignments), the students will enjoy it and their work will be of high quality and elaborate.	From this point of view, it is disadvantageous to do long-term projects with pupils, because it really takes a lot of hours.	Belief	[5, 3]	
2741	The amount of subject matter is no different from what we learned in elementary school, considering that it is taught from the same textbooks as it was in our time. From this point of view, it seems to me that the university prepares us for teaching in some ideal school, where the teacher has much more options. When the accompanying teachers gradually told me this information from practice, I felt quite frustrated.

3751	Most of the children had costumes and were excited when they could tell about them, however, they did not shout, but reported in an orderly manner. I personally had a very good feeling from this lesson and I believe that the children also took something away from it. I would never have believed that even in so many children it can be managed, but it really depends on the composition of the children and maybe their upbringing?	personally had a very good feeling from this lesson and I believe that the children also took something away from it.

2697	I would be happy if I could find at least a small part of the patience that this chemistry teacher has. I admire her for how she handled the situation. I felt very embarrassed about this lesson. On the one hand, I was frightened by the atmosphere of the class, unruly pupils and bored students, but also by the behavior of the class teacher. On the other hand, I have to admit that my accompanying teacher motivated me.	I felt very embarrassed about this lesson.	Feeling	[6, 7]	
2048	And then I try to transfer these tricks to my reality at school. I was not afraid of this class, i.e. the 3rd year of the 4-year high school. I had no fear in the 4th year of high school. In addition, the professor is directly the class teacher of this third grader, so she knows them very well.	I was not afraid of this class, i.e. the 3rd year of the 4-year high school.	Feeling	[3, 5]	
5394	In one lesson, I took on the role of an assistant, working independently with a boy from the 9th grade who needs a little more time to complete assignments. I was excited about this task, mainly because I was only on call all day, so I was happy to break my all-day stereotype. I worked very well with this student, he was very skilled and I had a very good feeling about his work.	I was excited about this task, mainly because I was only on call all day, so I was happy to break my all-day stereotype.	Feeling	[4, 5]	
5767	Maybe I'm overthinking it. However, it follows from this consideration that since the beginning of practice I am constantly afraid that I will not have sufficient authority and that I will not be able to obtain order and peace for work in the classroom. A lot of people around me tell me that I'm very nice, kind, polite and they can't imagine me in an educational role.	However, it follows from this consideration that since the beginning of practice I am constantly afraid that I will not have sufficient authority and that I will not be able to obtain order and peace for work in the classroom.

4346	So the classes sometimes ended up not covering everything I wanted to. I think I have learned from these mistakes and now we are able to do everything I want in the lessons and that (in my opinion) to a satisfactory quality. I also got the feeling that the students enjoy the lessons with me and I feel that they look forward to these lessons and give them something.	I think I have learned from these mistakes and now we are able to do everything I want in the lessons and that (in my opinion) to a satisfactory quality.	Reflection	[3, 6]	
5742	It can be seen that the teacher understands the issue, knows how to pass on knowledge and has respect for the students. In addition, I was surprised by the knowledge the students have in chemistry. I usually leave these listening classes excited and quite motivated.	usually leave these listening classes excited and quite motivated.	Feeling	[5, 6]	
4356	I realized that the students get tired easily and need to change their activities. At least I know how to proceed differently until next time. I left the class with a good feeling. The second lesson I taught music education to ninth graders. When I entered the classroom, I was horrified. Not only from the height of the students, but also from their views.	I left the class with a good feeling.	Feeling	[6, 6]	
6920	Maybe it's just my generalized view of the past, it is certain that I have retained this feeling of the hours in my memory until today. From the teacher's point of view, it was a pragmatic decision - he didn't bother with physics those who weren't passionate about it, and they didn't bother him in return. A pragmatic solution indeed, but something doesn't sit well with it.

1618	Of course, I have to fulfill what is written in the SVP, but that does not mean that I have to beat them to death.

5864	Each of the teachers talks about their class as the worst class in the world and namely they all talk down different students together and literally slander them and their parents. I know from my own experience that some teachers greatly exaggerate and embellish the situations that happened to them in their classes (I saw those situations and in my opinion they were completely manageable situations that happen everywhere in schools). The classes they take as the worst classes seem fine to me.

146	In short, I chose the school in question because it was close and because health education was also taught here, which, as I found out, is not the standard everywhere. I was assigned 8. C and 9. D. in health education, so it's a piece of cake. Noise, noise and noise. For the first 10 minutes, the teacher devotes herself only to somehow calming the students down.

3648	In the list of students, he selects an individual who has not yet been and the other grades are not very good, for example. He then crosses plus and minus points on the board according to the correctness of the answers. He evaluates the grade from the resulting ratio of positive and negative points.

407	The students actually did something similar to what we discussed together before, only with occasional variations. I walked around the classroom and helped out when needed. 7th graders were waiting for me in 2 days. classes. Since the teacher told me that they were still discussing Word, I stuck to this topic again.	7th graders were waiting for me in 2 days.	Other	[4, 4]	
3085	On the other hand, I am glad that I experienced how difficult it can be to work with a class when there is a bad atmosphere. In the 9th B., I was supposed to return to art education in the afternoon. And this time I didn't want to go there at all. As I went to the afternoon class, I wondered how I would let them know that I knew about their cheating on the test.	For 9.B. I had to go back to art class in the afternoon.	Experience	[5, 3]	
7079	But they had support. From natural conversation, it is difficult to pre-print what students will take home. But they can make notes themselves.

1087	The teacher also involved me in the lesson, asked me for additional information, wanted to help with a more concise wording (for example). In the end, my help was not needed, the students were really focused. I didn't really recognize it in an hour and it blew my mind how they have such respect, how they pay so much attention. I haven't really figured it out yet. In the second lesson, I was in the 8th grade on style. In advance, the teacher introduced me to the fact that he has a longer-term project with them.	I didn't really recognize it in an hour and it blew my mind how they have such respect, how they pay so much attention.	Reflection	[2, 4]	
4315	I realize that thanks to this I do very well in practice and I always look forward to it. So far I have taught 6 hours of mathematics and 2 hours of civic education. I consider teaching civics in 8th AA to be the strongest experience so far. The first week I went to this class to listen and already at that moment I realized that it would not be easy with them.	consider teaching civics in 8th A to be the strongest experience so far.

2317	"I really don't know if it's correct, because I think that teaching goes even worse this way, with such children who are constantly disturbing, shouting, not paying attention, etc. Before us, these children went to a special elementary school and the lessons were more peaceful , and we were able to concentrate more. Another surprise for me is the parents themselves, who have constant demands and ""problems"" and constantly complain about everything."	For us, these children still went to a special elementary school and the lessons were more peaceful, and we were able to concentrate more.	Other	[5, 4]	
5295	So I wouldn't let myself be put off like that and would try to motivate the children and get them excited about English. In a few years, they will blame themselves for learning English for so many years and still not being able to do much after all that time. So I lacked the teacher's motivation and enthusiasm. I also didn't like the discipline. The threats seemed empty to me, I wanted to see it through to the end. I would also rate the work in class.	In a few years, they will blame themselves for learning English for so many years and still not being able to do much after all that time.	Other	[6, 6]	
1437	So we are back, the holidays are short, but you can definitely see the difference in the teacher. he is more vital, more active, more involved in class, lessons are less frontal. Paradoxically, I consider the best hour when she forgot to come and didn't prepare anything 'proper'. It was a 6th grade lesson, two hours in the morning. The topic of the lesson was writing.	Paradoxically, I consider the best hour when she forgot to come and didn't prepare anything 'proper'.	Reflection	[4, 3]	
110	"However, the classes are very different and this is probably the result of some class teachers who did not raise the students in such a way that they don't talk as much as they want in class.

708	It was more of a tool for me and I must say that it really helped me a lot. First of all, I managed the time easily, and secondly, I sometimes distracted the students from myself, and I immediately spoke much more freely and naturally. I think initially for me it will use good presentations. As for the OV hours, I was completely sure about those, which surprised me.

4363	Unfortunately, two facts led me astray.

And secondly, the topic itself (as it turned out later) was too general for them. They had A4 size paper and crayons at their disposal.

1054	Before long they were writing a test and I was pleasantly surprised when almost all of them gave the correct answer to the topic I discussed with them. A few days later, I came back to this class, and right from the start it was clear to me that something had happened to them. Many changed their place, behaved better, the overall atmosphere was more pleasant, they actively reported to class and participated in activities.

6805	In the office, after the lesson, we analyzed the individual passages of the lesson, which was beneficial for me. I greatly appreciate the teacher's acknowledgment of a small mistake at the end of the lesson, when all the students started packing up when the bell rang and no one was listening to his explanation.

96	Really the best lesson for which the teacher later apologized to me. I don't understand, I don't understand. Not much has changed so far this semester. It took a few weeks when I didn't have the opportunity or time to teach and I got used to standing in front of the blackboard again.	Not much has changed so far this semester.	Other	[3, 4]	
3296	And I think that the students were also satisfied and they liked and enjoyed the topics. I can also be grateful to my accompanying teacher for that, because before every lesson I had to teach, I could discuss everything with her and she told me her opinions about it.

5200	Anyway, when I look back and recap the previous part of the practice, I would very much like to use some of the elements in the school that the teacher uses. I thank the teacher for that. So far, I have completed listening lessons in chemistry classes with eighth and ninth graders. The teacher teaches mathematics to both classes and from this year also chemistry.	I thank the teacher for that.	Other	[5, 6]	
5502	I would be happy if I could find at least a small part of the patience that this chemistry teacher has. I admire her for how she handled the situation. I felt very embarrassed about this lesson.

4083	Although a bit plucked and not quite a breakthrough phoenix, it still looks quite majestic in my head (except that it squints). In those three weeks, I managed to get rid of my doubts about the choice of my profession and convince myself that teaching is actually not so bad and it is quite a nice mission.

3457	However, the class was a success as a result, everyone joined the discussion beautifully and I thought they enjoyed it. I was really pleasantly surprised by the course of the lesson. In a week, I went to 8. And again to teach civic education. And teach civics again. The teacher and I agreed that I would make the class rules with them, which they would then post in the classroom.

1583	I caused the crisis on purpose to let them know that I knew about their nagging. But then I couldn't wrap up the situation to get them to listen carefully. I consider my failure to keep my promise to be a big mistake. At the beginning of the lesson, I promised that I would praise the one who got the most correct answers from the questions in the video.

I started the class and assigned the work and no one objected, everyone opened their notebooks and started copying the assignment from the board. My hands finally stopped shaking.

3109	Pupils' motivation for the subject is relatively high. I think it's better than the previous schools I've visited. This is certainly the merit of the teacher.

This is certainly the merit of the teacher.	Other	[6, 5]	
6798	How should I take it? Moreover, the children are mixed from different social spheres. No one wants to work with one guy. Why? How is it possible that they do not want to accept him among themselves. I wonder what's behind it. The girls are rolling on the ground during one of the activities and have a fit of laughter.

3049	We somehow got through this activity and then I purposely put him in a group where nobody listened to him much and they really did the tasks, so he didn't have room to express himself.

355	As I am an assistant in their class, I know well how they pay attention in other classes, so I was completely surprised. I wonder how the teacher does it, how she has such respect. She didn't raise her voice once for the whole hour, she spoke calmly. One day I would also like to achieve such attention in the class. I started my internship on October 11, 2018.

3325	The teacher introduced the children to the assignment at the beginning of the lesson. They had the task of painting themselves with their grandparents in means of transport.

3903	I would probably explode at this point. The teacher reacts quite calmly. I guess I have to learn patience. Same class as last time, same scenario, just more kids.

But then again, there are some who are not interested in doing anything about it.	I wonder if those eighth graders ever think about themselves.	Feeling	[3, 3]

231	Pupils are actively involved in the lesson, the teachers do not only teach face-to-face, but civic education lessons are fun and beneficial, everyone gets involved.

4627	It is probably true that the job of language teachers in elementary school is to motivate children to not be afraid to speak, even if they are unsure. However, I have not yet come to a clear conclusion and I would like to talk about this approach with the teacher.

260	In reality, however, the difference between the first and second degree doesn't seem so great to me, I have a rather strong feeling from the practice, as if we are throwing away our English and teaching potential. So far, it looks like I probably won't be able to get into the basics, and if I teach at all, I'll focus more on language classes, where I'll be able to better adapt the lessons to both the students and myself.

The feedback was also good, but the teacher criticized me, independently of the previous feedback, that I should wait longer for silence if I want to say something even during group work. This confirmed for me what I want to focus on for the next week of my teaching. Waiting longer for complete silence in the classroom.

1747	Although I forbade one boy to get up and collect them three times, he still collected them before the bell rang and before everyone had finished. I taught in all grades of the second grade. In retrospect, it is interesting to observe that although I was equally strict with everyone, each class perceived me more or less differently. While the eighth-graders rated me as too strict, I impressed the seventh-graders too mildly.	In retrospect, it is interesting to observe that although I was equally strict with everyone, each class perceived me more or less differently.	Reflection	[3, 6]	
2252	When the teacher gives such punishments on a regular basis? I suppose that when the boys confessed, they must have known that some kind of punishment was coming. In retrospect, I think that I could have at least proposed a slightly different solution to the teacher. Since it was my first day at practice, I didn't know what I could talk about and what I couldn't.	In retrospect, I think that I could have at least proposed a slightly different solution to the teacher.	Reflection	[4, 6]	
5108	I managed to get all but one of the ninth graders, while maybe only 4 of the seventh graders were satisfied with me.

I went prepared, but if I didn't motivate them enough? It would be interesting to try them again.

5125	This time I wanted to avoid this problem, so I explained everything to the students really carefully. I also picked up the drawing, put a sheet on it and said that this is exactly what I don't want from them. That the goal is to enlarge the given structure to the entire drawing.

2583	The next class started again in a similar way to the previous one. At the beginning, the teacher expertly reminds the content of the previous lesson and thus strengthens the overall continuity of the material discussed in the students. He also manages it with a humorous insert, which does not disrupt the course of the activities in any way, on the contrary, it has a very positive effect and breaks down possible barriers between the teacher and the student. Everyone, including me, already feels well tuned for the upcoming lesson within the first few minutes. In the first minutes, class issues are also classically resolved.

6311	Another option was to sit at the front of the class on the edge so that I could have a view from the teacher's perspective. The third option offered was a combination of the previous ones. So I chose to sit in the front, but I didn't notice any change for me. The beginnings of his classes tend to be the same, organizational matters, oral repetition of the material discussed in the form of questions for the class.

173	Knowing the students' names is, in my opinion, absolutely essential. My accompanying teacher probably has nothing to build on. He shows no interest in the pupils. I don't sense interest in her either from her expression, or from her approach, and certainly not from her approach. Her approach is completely impersonal. If I don't show interest in them, they won't show interest in me, and therefore not even in the subject I teach.	don't sense interest in her either from her expression, or from her approach, and certainly not from her approach.

672	However, the reality is quite different from what we see at the practices themselves. Society, in which teachers do not have a very rosy position, also plays a big role in this situation.

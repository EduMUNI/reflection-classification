You can use a library `gdown` to download pretrained models, just like in `\analyses` notebooks, 
or download the folder manually: 

```bash
pip install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Sv0OpLyi13HA5miRxbi5HNGmziJ0yQwt -O xlm-roberta-large-confidence4+-cs.zip
mkdir models
unzip xlm-roberta-large-confidence4+.zip -d models
```
